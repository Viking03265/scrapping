        "description": "During the early colonial encounter, children's books were among the first kinds of literature produced by US writers introducing the new colony, its people, and the US's role as a twentieth-century colonial power to the public. Subsequently, youth literature and media were important tools of Puerto Rican cultural and educational elite institutions and Puerto Rican revolutionary thought as a means of negotiating US assimilation and upholding a strong Latin American, Caribbean national stance. \n\nIn Side by Side: US Empire, Puerto Rico, and the Roots of American Youth Literature and Culture, author Marilisa Jimenez Garcia focuses on the contributions of the Puerto Rican community to American youth, approaching Latinx literature as a transnational space that provides a critical lens for examining the lingering consequences of US and Spanish colonialism for US communities of color. Through analysis of such texts typically outside traditional Latinx or literary studies as young adult literature, textbooks, television programming, comics, music, curriculum, and youth movements, Side by Side represents the only comprehensive study of the contributions of Puerto Rican...show more",

The resplendent visual-verbal storyworlds of these artists reach into and radically transform so many visual and storytelling genres. Tales from la Vida celebrates this space by bringing together more than eighty contributions by extraordinary Latinx creators. Their short visual-verbal narratives spring from autobiographical experience as situated within the language, culture, and history that inform Latinx identity and life. Tales from la Vida showcases the huge variety of styles and worldviews of today's Latinx comic book and visual creators. \n\nWhether it's detailing the complexities of growing up--mono- or multilingual, bicultural, straight, queer, or feminist Latinx--or focusing on aspects of pop culture, these graphic vignettes demonstrate the expansive complexity of Latinx identities. Taken individually and together, these creators--including such legendary artists as Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez, Roberta Gregory, and Kat Fajardo, to name a few--and their works show the world that when it comes to Latinx comics, there are no limits to matters of content and form.

Our southern borders are overrun by asylum seekers; migrants fleeing violence, corruption, kidnapping, rape, rampant crime, human trafficking, and human rights abuses that few of us can imagine, let alone survive through. Arturo Jiménez, an experienced family Immigration Lawyer, humanizes the issue, utilizing stories of his clients to help us understand the causes and effects of the migration of Latinx children and families from The Violent Central Triangle of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and the surrounding states of Nicaragua and Mexico to the United States.

To everyone who knows them, best friends Miel and Sam are as strange as they are inseparable. Roses grow out of Miel's wrist, and rumors say that she spilled out of a water tower when she was five. Sam is known for the moons he paints and hangs in the trees and for how little anyone knows about his life before he and his mother moved to town. But as odd as everyone considers Miel and Sam, even they stay away from the Bonner girls, four beautiful sisters rumored to be witches. Now they want the roses that grow from Miel's skin, convinced that their scent can make anyone fall in love.

But when the animals in town start disappearing, and Nestor's grandmother is spotted in the woods where they were last seen, suspicion mounts against her. Nestor learns that they are being taken by a tule vieja, a witch who bites animals to gain their power, and his extraordinary ability is put front and center as he tries to catch the real culprit and clear his grandmother's name. \n",

It showcases relationships between families and schools and reveals the myriad of ways in which school-based decisions regarding disability, language and academic placement impact family dynamics. Treating the mothers as experts, this book uses testimonios to explore not only what mothers know but also how they develop funds of knowledge and how they apply them to their child's education. The stories shed light on how mothers perceive their child's disability, how they engage with their child and the value they place on bilingualism. The narratives reveal the complex lives mothers lead and the ways in which they strive to meet the academic and socioemotional needs of their children, regardless of the financial, physical and emotional costs to them.

        "description": "A leading text for courses that go beyond the basics of family systems theory, intervention techniques, and diversity, this influential work has now been significantly revised with 65% new material. The volume explores how family relationships--and therapy itself--are profoundly shaped by race, social class, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and other intersecting dimensions of marginalization and privilege. Chapters from leading experts guide the practitioner to challenge assumptions about family health and pathology, understand the psychosocial impact of oppression, and tap into clients' cultural resources for healing. Practical clinical strategies are interwoven with theoretical insights, case examples, training ideas, and therapists' reflections on their own cultural and family legacies. \n\nNew to This Edition \n*Existing chapters have been thoroughly updated and 21 chapters added, expanding the perspectives in the book. \n*Reflects over a decade of theoretical and clinical advances and the growing diversity of the United States. \n*New sections on re-visioning clinical research, trauma and psychological homelessness, and larger systems. \n",

        "description": "From lauded writer David Valdes, a sharp and funny YA novel that's Back to the Future with a twist, as a gay teen travels back to his parents' era to save a closeted classmate's life. All Luis Gonzalez wants is to go to prom with his boyfriend, something his \"progressive\" school still doesn't allow. Not after what happened with Chaz Wilson. But that was ages ago, when Luis's parents were in high school; it would never happen today, right? He's determined to find a way to give his LGBTQ friends the respect they deserve (while also not risking his chance to be prom king, just saying...). When a hit on the head knocks him back in time to 1985 and he meets the doomed young Chaz himself, Luis concocts a new plan-he's going to give this guy his first real kiss. Though it turns out a conservative school in the '80s isn't the safest place to be a gay kid. Especially with homophobes running the campus, including Gordo (aka Luis's estranged father). Luis is in over his head, trying not to make things worse-and hoping he makes it back to present day at all. In a story that's fresh, intersectional, and wickedly funny, David Valdes introduces a big-mouthed, big-hearted queer character that readers won't soon forget. \n",

        "description": "Growing up Latino in America means speaking two languages, living two lives, learning the rules of two cultures. Cool Salsa celebrates the tones, rhythms, sounds, and experiences of that double life. Here are poems about families and parties, insults and sad memories, hot dogs and mangos, the sweet syllables of Spanish and the snag-toothed traps of English. Here is the glory--and pain--of being Latino American. Latino Americans hail from Cuba and California, Mexico and Michigan, Nicaragua and New York, and editor Lori M. Carlson has made sure to capture all of those accents. With poets such as Sandra Cisneros, Martín Espada, Gary Soto, and Ed Vega, and a very personal introduction by Oscar Hijuelos, this collection encompasses the voices of Latino America. By selecting poems about the experiences of teenagers, Carlson has given a focus to that rich diversity; by presenting the poems both in their original language and in translation, she has made them available to us all. As you move from memories of red wagons to dreams of orange trees to fights with street gangs, you feel Cool Salsa's musical and emotional cross rhythms. Here is a world of exciting poetry for you, y tú también. \n",

En Español! Selena Quintanilla's music career began at the age of nine when she started singing in her family's band. She went from using a hairbrush as a microphone to traveling from town to town to play gigs. But Selena faced a challenge: People said that she would never make it in Tejano music, which was dominated by male performers. Selena was determined to prove them wrong. Born and raised in Texas, Selena didn't know how to speak Spanish, but with the help of her dad, she learned to sing it. With songs written and composed by her older brother, and the fun dance steps Selena created, her band, Selena Y Los Dinos, rose to stardom! A true trailblazer, her success in Tejano music and her crossover into mainstream American music opened the door for other Latinx entertainers, and she became an inspiration for Latina girls everywhere. \n",

In the city of Bogata, in the barrio of La Nueva Gloria, there live two Joses. One is a boy who dreams of Saturdays-- that's the day he gets to visit Paradise, the library. The second Jose is a garbage collector. From dusk until dawn, he scans the sidewalks as he drives, squinting in the dim light, searching household trash for hidden treasure . . . books! Some are stacked in neat piles, as if waiting for José́. Others take a bit more digging. Ever since he found his first book, Anna Karenina, years earlier, he's been collecting books--thick ones and thin ones, worn ones and almost new ones-- to add to the collection in his home. And on Saturdays, kids like little Jose run to the steps of Paradise to discover a world filled with books and wonder. With an evocative text by a debut author, and rich, stunning illustrations from an up-and-coming Colombian illustrator, here is a celebration of perseverance, community, and the power of books. \n",

        "description": "In this memoir full of humor and heart, comedian, writer, and producer Cristela Alonzo shares personal stories of growing up as a first-generation Mexican-American in Texas and following her dreams to pursue a career in comedy. When Cristela Alonzo and her family lived as squatters in an abandoned diner, they only had two luxuries: a television and a radio, which became her pop cultural touchstone and a guiding light. Cristela shares her experiences and struggles of being a first-generation American, her dreams of becoming a comedian, and how it feels to be a creator in a world that often minimizes people of color and women. Her stories range from the ridiculous--like the time she made her own tap shoes out of bottle caps or how the theme song of The Golden Girls landed her in the principal's office--to the sobering moments, like how she turned to stand-up comedy to grieve the heartbreaking loss of her mother and how, years later, she's committed to giving back to the community that helped make her. Each significant moment of the book relates to a song, and the resulting playlist is deeply moving, resonant, and unforgettable. Music to My Years will make you laugh, cry, and even inspire you to make a playlist of your own. \n",

Black children, Native children, Latinx children, and the children of the poor have all been seized from their kin and caregivers. As Laura Briggs's sweeping narrative shows, the practice played out on the auction block, in the boarding schools designed to pacify the Native American population, in the foster care system used to put down the Black freedom movement, in the US's anti-Communist coups in Central America, and in the moral panic about \"crack babies.\" In chilling detail we see how Central Americans were made into a population that could be stripped of their children and how every US administration beginning with Reagan has put children of immigrants and refugees in detention camps. Yet these tactics of terror have encountered opposition from every generation, and Briggs challenges us to stand and resist in this powerful corrective to American history. \n",

        "description": "The banning of Mexican-American Studies and censorship of Chican@-authored books in Arizona were part of a succession of anti-Mexican and anti-Chican@ policies that were enacted across the state and in the education system. The counterstories offered through these classes and literature not only created a sense of cultural inclusion, but ignited a political and activist consciousness among the mostly Chican@ youth, and reinvigorated conversations among educators about the teaching of race, ethnicity, and culture in the classroom, particularly through youth literature. While most work on youth literature has emphasized \"multicultural\" literature as a means of being inclusive, Voices of Resistance: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Chican@ Children's Literature recognizes that our present moment--one that is rife with continued anti-Mexican sentiment but that has given rise to our first Chicano National Poet Laureate--demands a more focused study of children's and young adult literature by and about Chican@s. This collection re-examines how we view multicultural and diversity literature and recognize literature that invites social transformation.

Research finds that the number of girls who said that they often felt nervous, worried, or fearful jumped 55 percent from 2009 to 2014, while the comparable number for adolescent boys has remained unchanged. As a clinical psychologist who specializes in working with girls, Lisa Damour, Ph.D., has witnessed this rising tide of stress and anxiety in her own research, in private practice, and in the all-girls' school where she consults. She knew this had to be the topic of her new book. In the engaging, anecdotal style and reassuring tone that won over thousands of readers of her first book, Untangled, Damour starts by addressing the facts about psychological pressure.

Now and then, glimpses of the racist and discriminatory border world tell a more nuanced and complicated narrative than the apparent calm existence gleaned from the child's perspective. Pinky García, the main character, is smart, spunky, outspoken, a keen observer, and loves a good joke! She publishes a newspaper, has a radio program, hosts parties, and otherwise engages in adventures that set this childhood apart and is a testament to the ways family can empower young people to develop and be all they can be. Nama, her maternal grandmother, imparts life lessons and Pop and Mom allow her imagination to thrive and encourage her exploits.

In the summer before eighth grade, Marco Suarez kissed his best friend Sally Blake. This was his first spark. And since then, whenever he's thought about that moment, he's traveled through a wormhole--of sorts--to relive those brief seconds when time sped up (or, rather, his view of time distorted) and he kissed her. And then, at the end of that year, she disappeared, leaving in that way that people sometimes leave--alive and well and somewhere out there but gone, nonetheless. She never even said why. And now in their senior year, Sally unexpectedly returns and Marco is shaken. Still, he holds tightly to his carefully choreographed life. A life that is full of reasons why first sparks don't matter: Reason 1: He has a girlfriend. Her name is Erika Richards. \nReason 2: He's leaving on a full scholarship to college. \nReason 3: He's busy with his friends and making money to help support his family. But as Marco navigates the final days of high school, he learns that leaving home is never easy and a first spark is hard to ignore. \n",

Romance. Resistance. Enter a world straight out of Argentine folklore... Following the events of Lobizona, Manu and her friends cross the mystical border into Kerana--a cursed realm in Argentina--searching for allies and a hiding place. As they chase down leads about the Coven--a mythical resistance manada that might not even exist--the Cazadores chase down leads about Manu, setting up traps to capture and arrest her. Just as it seems the Cazadores have Manu and her friends cornered, the Coven answers their call for help. As Manu catches her breath among these non-conforming Septimus, she discovers they need a revolution as much as she does. But is she the right one to lead them? After all, hybrids aren't just outlawed. They're feared and reviled. What happens when the Coven learns of Manu's dual heritage? Will they still protect her? Or will they betray her? And after running this far, for this long--how much farther can Manu go before her feet get tired, and she stops to take a stand? \n",

Savor this book and share it with people you love.--A. M. Juster Rhina P. Espaillat, more than any living poet in English, gives ordinary language the glow of the sacred. Workaday words, trite with custom like thin coins, accrue new resonance and weight; plain objects are haloed with aureoles like figures in gold mosaics. Saints with their visions used to do this: wave away the veils that separate our shallow perceptions from a deeper reality. But not everyone is granted visions. How much harder it is to use the same words we all use and misuse, the same objects we all touch and ignore, common experiences we dismiss, and, by using words with precision, using the serendipity of rhyme, and the convention of metrical patterns, to give the reader the experience of revelation.

But Anamaria's thirteen, she knows better than to talk to a stranger. Girls need to be careful, especially in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico-it's the 90's and fear is overtaking her beloved city as cases of kidnapped girls and women become alarmingly common. This thirty-year-old \"future\" lady doesn't seem to be dangerous but she won't stop bothering her, switching between cheesy Hallmark advice about being kind to yourself, and some mysterious talk about saving a girl.\n\nAnamaria definitely doesn't need any saving, she's doing just fine.

The DREAM Act is the only federal legislation that would grant conditional citizenship and some financial aid assistance to undocumented students who have completed two years of college or enlist in military service. Since the DREAM Act failed to pass, undocumented students have moved from peaceful marches to acts of civil disobedience, seeking to disrupt the public discourse that positions undocumented students as living in the shadows of our system. Undocumented college students have created public forums in which they \"come out\" from these invisible images and pronounce themselves as \"undocumented and unafraid\". \n",

Eleven-year-old Lorenzo Ventura knows heroes are rare--like his father, who died in the war, or his friend Paloma Lee, who fearlessly pursues her dream of being a famous musician. Renzo would never describe himself as a hero, but his chance comes when he adopts Marty, a runt piglet. Marty is extraordinary--he thinks he's a dog and acts like one too--and his bond with Renzo is truly one of a kind. At first, the family farm seems like the perfect home for Marty, but as he approaches 350 pounds, it becomes harder for Renzo to convince his mom that a giant pig makes a good pet. So when Marty causes a dangerous (and expensive) accident, Renzo knows Marty's time is up. He'd do anything and everything for his best friend, but will everything be enough to save Marty? Paul Griffin masterfully melds the heartrending and the hopeful in this unforgettable story about the power of friendship . . . and the unsung heroes all around us. \n",

When Zezé grows up, he wants to be a poet in a bow tie. For now the precocious young boy entertains himself by playing clever pranks on the residents of his Rio de Janeiro neighborhood, stunts for which his parents and siblings punish him severely. Lately, with his father out of work, the beatings have become harsher. Zezé's only solace comes from his time at school, his hours secretly spent singing with a street musician, and the refuge he finds with his precious magical orange tree. When Zezé finally makes a real friend, his life begins to change, opening him up to human tenderness but also wrenching sorrow. Never out of print in Brazil since it was first published in 1968, My Sweet Orange Tree, inspired by the author's own childhood, has been translated into many languages and has won the hearts of millions of young readers across the globe. \n",

That's what the government insists that this era must be called, but the reality behind these words is starvation. Liana is struggling to find enough to eat. Yet hunger has also made her brave: she finds the courage to skip a summer of so-called volunteer farm labor, even though she risks government retribution. Nearby, a quiet, handsome boy named Amado also refuses to comply, so he wanders alone, trying to discover rare sources of food. A chance encounter with an enigmatic dog brings Liana and Amado together. United in hope and hunger, they soon discover that their feelings for each other run deep.

Juntos, estos hermanos valientes rescatan gatos perdidos, regañan a niños abusones y resuelven misterios, todo antes de que Mami y Papi lleguen a casa.

        "description": "People's experiences of racial inequality in adulthood are well documented, but less attention is given to the racial inequalities that children and adolescents face. Growing Up in America provides a rich, first-hand account of the different social worlds that teens of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds experience. In their own words, these American teens describe, conflicts with parents, pressures from other teens, school experiences, and religious beliefs that drive their various understandings of the world. As the book reveals, teens' unequal experiences have a significant impact on their adult lives and their potential for social mobility. Directly confronting the constellation of advantages and disadvantages white, black, Hispanic, and Asian teens face today, this work provides a framework for understanding the relationship between socialization in adolescence and social inequality in adulthood. By uncovering the role racial and ethnic differences play early on, we can better understand the sources of inequality in American life. \n",

Sayman pushed Facebook to build its own version of Snapchat's Stories and, as a result, engagement on the platform soared across all demographics.

Cuando Cristela Alonzo y su familia vivían como invasores en una cafetería abandonada, solo tenían dos lujos: una televisión y una radio, que se convirtieron en la piedra de toque de la cultura pop y la fuente de inspiración para la futura comediante. Cristela comparte sus experiencias y luchas al ser una estadounidense de primera generación; sus sueños de convertirse en comediante; y lo que se siente al ser creadora en un mundo que a menudo minimiza a la gente que no es blanca y a las mujeres. Sus historias van de lo ridículo--como cuando hizo sus propios zapatos de tap con corcholatas o cuando, por el tema musical de Las chicas de oro, acabó en la oficina de la directora de su escuela- hasta momentos aleccionadores, como cuando incursionó en la comedia de monólogos para sobrellevar el terrible dolor por la pérdida de su madre y cómo, años después, se ha comprometido para apoyar a la comunidad que la ayudó a formarse.

It's been three years since ICE raids and phone calls from Mexico and an ill-fated walk across the Sonoran. Three years since Sia Martinez's mom disappeared. Sia wants to move on, but it's hard in her tiny Arizona town where people refer to her mom's deportation as \"an unfortunate incident.\" Sia knows that her mom must be dead, but every new moon Sia drives into the desert and lights San Anthony and la Guadalupe candles to guide her mom home. Then one night, under a million stars, Sia's life and the world as we know it cracks wide open. Because a blue-lit spacecraft crashes in front of Sia's car...and it's carrying her mom, who's very much alive. As Sia races to save her mom from armed-quite-possibly-alien soldiers, she uncovers secrets as profound as they are dangerous in this stunning and inventive exploration of first love, family, immigration, and our vast, limitless universe. \n",

        "description": "This edgy fantasy doesn't just blur boundaries of genre, of gender, of past and present, life and death--it explodes them. --Cinda Williams Chima, New York Times bestselling author of The Seven Realms and The Shattered Realms Without the dead, she'd be no one. Odessa is one of Karthia's master necromancers, catering to the kingdom's ruling Dead. Whenever a noble dies, it's Odessa's job to raise them by retrieving their soul from a dreamy and dangerous shadow world called the Deadlands. But there is a cost to being raised: the Dead must remain shrouded. If even a hint of flesh is exposed, a grotesque transformation begins, turning the Dead into terrifying, bloodthirsty Shades. A dramatic uptick in Shade attacks raises suspicions and fears around the kingdom. Soon, a crushing loss of one of her closest companions leaves Odessa shattered, and reveals a disturbing conspiracy in Karthia: Someone is intentionally creating Shades by tearing shrouds from the Dead--and training them to attack. Odessa is forced to contemplate a terrifying question: What if her magic is the weapon that brings the kingdom to its knees? Fighting alongside her fellow mages--and a powerful girl as enthralling as she is infuriating--Odessa must untangle the gruesome plot to destroy Karthia before the Shades take everything she loves. Perfect for fans of Three...show more",

The black hole swallows everything he touches, which is challenging to say the least--but also turns out to be a convenient way to get rid of those items that Stella doesn't want around. Soon the ugly sweaters her aunt has made for her all disappear within the black hole, as does the smelly class hamster she's taking care of, and most important, all the reminders of her dead father that are just too painful to have around. It's not until Stella, her younger brother, Cosmo, the family puppy, and even the bathroom tub all get swallowed up by the black hole that Stella comes to realize she has been letting her own grief consume her. And that's not the only thing she realizes as she attempts to get back home. This is an astonishingly original and funny adventure with a great big heart. \n",

One young woman's journey to find her place in the world as the carefully separated strands of her life -- family, money, school, and love -- begin to overlap and tangle. All sixteen-year-old Izzy Crawford wants is to feel like she really belongs somewhere. Her father, a marine, died in Iraq six years ago, and Izzy's moved to a new town nearly every year since, far from the help of her extended family in North Carolina and Puerto Rico. When Izzy's hardworking mom moves their small family to Virginia, all her dreams start clicking into place. She likes her new school--even if Izzy is careful to keep her scholarship-student status hidden from her well-to-do classmates and her new athletic and popular boyfriend. And best of all: Izzy's family has been selected by Habitat for Humanity to build and move into a brand-new house. Izzy is this close to the community and permanence she's been searching for, until all the secret pieces of her life begin to collide. How to Build a Heart is the story of Izzy's journey to find her place in the world and her discovery that the choices we make and the people we love ultimately define us and bring us home. \n",

Cuando un giro del destino le presentó una oportunidad única en la cadena noticiera Telemundo en Miami, estaba emocionada de comenzar una nueva vida --e identidad-- en los Estados Unidos, donde las fronteras raciales, creía, se habían disuelto hace mucho tiempo y la igualdad era la regla. Sin embargo, se enfrentó a otro tipo de discriminación racial como una mujer inmigrante de color que le hablaba en español a la comunidad latinx cada vez más marginada. En los últimos nueve años, Ilia ha reportado desde la primera línea de eventos históricos como el huracán Katrina, los terremotos en México, las elecciones p...show more",

Is this self-segregation a problem to address or a coping strategy? Beverly Daniel Tatum, a renowned authority on the psychology of racism, argues that straight talk about our racial identities is essential if we are serious about enabling communication across racial and ethnic divides. These topics have only become more urgent as the national conversation about race is increasingly acrimonious. This fully revised edition is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the dynamics of race in America. \n",

As a little boy, Rubén Darío loved to listen to his great uncle, a man who told tall tales in a booming, larger-than-life voice. Rubén quickly learned the magic of storytelling, and discovered the rapture and beauty of verse. A restless and romantic soul, Rubén traveled across Central and South America seeking adventure and connection. As he discovered new places and new loves, he wrote poems to express his wild storm of feelings. But the traditional forms felt too restrictive. He began to improvise his own poetic forms so he could capture the entire world in his words. At the age of twenty-one, he published his first book Azul, which heralded a vibrant new literary movement called Modernismo that blended poetry and prose into something magical.

Discover this compelling memoir from an inspirational teenage activist, now a Lifetime movie. It started as a school project, but it turned into so much more. Growing up, Gaby Rodriguez was often told she would end up a teen mom. After all, her mother and her older sisters had gotten pregnant as teenagers; from an outsider's perspective, it was practically a family tradition. Gaby had ambitions that didn't include teen motherhood. But she wondered: how would she be treated if she fulfilled others' expectations? Would everyone ignore the years she put into being a good student and see her as just another pregnant teen statistic with no future? These questions sparked Gaby's high school senior project: faking her own pregnancy to see how her family, friends, and community would react. What she learned changed her life forever...and made international headlines in the process. In The Pregnancy Project, Gaby details how she was able to fake her own pregnancy, hiding the truth from even her siblings and boyfriend's parents, and reveals all that she learned from the experience. But more than that, Gaby's story is about fighting stereotypes, and how one girl found the strength to come out from the shadow of low expectations to forge a bright...show more",

Things deteriorate further when government-backed drug gangs arrive and take control of the village.

Luna has been missing for several months. The police, Dora, Andrea and members of the community have searched for Luna with no success.

Thousands of young Navy sailors are pouring into Los Angeles on their way to the front lines of World War II. They are teenagers, scared, longing to feel alive before they have to face the horrors of battle. Hot jazz music spiced with cool salsa rhythms beckons them to dance with the local Mexican American girls, who jitterbug all night before working all day in the canneries. Proud to do their part for the war effort, these Jazz Owl girls are happy to dance with the sailors--until the blazing summer night when racial violence leads to murder. Suddenly the young white sailors are attacking the girls' brothers and boyfriends. The cool, loose zoot suits they wear are supposedly the reason for the violence--when in reality the boys are viciously beaten and arrested simply because of the color of their skin. In soaring images and searing poems, this is the breathtaking story of what became known as the Zoot Suit Riots. \n",

Pulled off the streets when she was twelve years old, Aina was trained to become one of the most powerful and dangerous assassins in Sumerand, a kingdom founded by immigrants, built by magic, and still reeling from an industrial revolution that's led to all-out civil war. Fearless and willing to risk everything - and with nothing left to lose - Aina is ready to leave her wretched past behind and accept a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: to kill a wealthy industrialist named Kouta. But this career-defining move won't come easy. She will have to act against her boss Kohl, who doesn't tolerate his assassins working against him. What will be the price for her betrayal? Meanwhile, the closer Aina gets to her target, the more she craves an answer to the questions an assassin is never meant to ask: Who wants Kouta dead? And why was Aina chosen for this mission?\n\nNow, in a city full of dark forces and hidden agendas, old rivalries and a whole new world of enemies, it's up to Aina to unravel a conspiracy that could rewrite Sumerand's history and her own future. Is it too late to save her city - and herself? Is courage born or is it bred? And what must Aina sacrifice for a second chance to begin a bett...show more",

Not death.\"\n\nIn his final days, beloved and ailing patriarch Miguel Angel de La Cruz, affectionately called Big Angel, has summoned his entire clan for one last legendary birthday party. But as the party approaches, his mother, nearly one hundred, dies herself, leading to a farewell doubleheader in a single weekend. Among the guests is Big Angel's half brother, known as Little Angel, who must reckon with the truth that although he shares a father with his siblings, he has not, as a half gringo, shared a life.\n\nAcross two bittersweet days in their San Diego neighborhood, the revelers mingle among the palm trees and cacti, celebrating the lives of Big Angel and his mother, and recounting the many inspiring tales that have passed into family lore, the acts both ordinary and heroic that brought these citizens to a fraught and sublime country and allowed them to flourish in the land they have come to call home.show more",

        "description": "From the author of Make Your Home Among Strangers, essays on being an \"accidental\" American--an incisive look at the edges of identity for a woman of color in a society centered on whiteness In this sharp and candid collection of essays, critically acclaimed writer and first-generation American Jennine Capó Crucet explores the condition of finding herself a stranger in the country where she was born. Raised in Miami and the daughter of Cuban refugees, Crucet examines the political and personal contours of American identity and the physical places where those contours find themselves smashed: be it a rodeo town in Nebraska, a university campus in upstate New York, or Disney World in Florida. Crucet illuminates how she came to see her exclusion from aspects of the theoretical American Dream, despite her family's attempts to fit in with white American culture--beginning with their ill-fated plan to name her after the winner of the Miss America pageant. In prose that is both fearless and slyly humorous, My Time Among the Whites examines the sometimes hopeful, sometimes deeply flawed ways in which many Americans have learned to adapt, exist, and--in the face of all signals saying otherwise--perhaps even thrive in a country that never imagined them here. \n",

Bone! Betty Cooper and Val Smith are best friends ready to start middle school. They've always done everything together--taken the same classes, played the same games, and created the world of Sparklespacelandia in Betty's backyard together--so naturally, Betty assumes they'll continue to be an unbreakable duo once the school year starts. But Val finds herself drawn toward pursuing a music elective, and does it without Betty at her side. Suddenly Betty's on her own for the first time since Val moved to the neighborhood, and she's struggling to deal with being lumped in with the loser drama class--that just happens to be dominated by snotty and powerful Veronica Lodge! Even the presence of other friends like Archie, Jughead, and Sabrina isn't making Betty feel better about her estrangement from Val.

De niño, a Rubén Darío le gustaba escuchar a su tío abuelo, un hombre que contaba cuentos exagerados con una poderosa voz de trueno. Rubén aprendió bien pronto la magia de contar cuentos y descubrió el embeleso y la belleza del verso. Con su incansable alma romántica, Rubén viajó a través de América Central y América del Sur en busca de aventura y conexión. Mientras descubría nuevos lugares y amores, escribía poemas para expresar la tormenta salvaje de sentimientos. Pero las formas tradicionales eran muy restrictivas. Comenzó a improvisar sus propias formas poéticas para plasmar el mundo entero en sus palabras. A la edad de veintiún años, publicó su primer libro, Azul, que anunció un nuevo y vibrante movimiento literario llamado Modernismo que combinaba poesía y prosa y convertía esa mezcla en algo mágico. En sus hermosos poemas, Margarita Engle cuenta la historia de este apasionado joven que revolucionó la literatura mundial. \n",

Mientras Yo goza su celebridad, sus seres queridos se encuentran “desnudos” y reconocibles ante el mundo en su nueva via pública. ¿Cuál es el resultado? Aqellos que fueron “victimizados por la ficción” quieren contar su lado de la historia.\n Y así mismo lo hacen en ésta, la novela de Julia Alvarez, alegre, conmovedora y bien concebida, ¡Yo! se trata del conflicto entre el arte y al realidad, el intelecto y las emociones, y el aculturamiento en los Estados Unidos y sus propias raíces dominicanas. Aquí, las tres hermanas de Yo, su mamá y papá, sus abuelos, tías, tíos, primos y esposos protagonizan sus versions de la verdadera vida de Yo. Alvarez hace que les creamos a todos y a la indomable Yo, cuyo impulse creative está arraigado en sus recuerdos infantiles y sus dos contrastantes culturas.\n Esta novela expresa plenamente el alma de una mujer, medita sobre la vida de una escritora y recuerda líricamente la búsqueda de identidad del inmigrante. ¡Yo! es desulmbrante, matizada, repleta de conversaciones sabrosas, gran calor humano y genuina percepción que sólo puda haber escrito Julia Alvarez.",

Yet now that travel laws have changed and it's a lot easier for divided families to be reunited, his mom thinks it's time for some father-son bonding.

The book explores the authentic experiences and challenges faced by bilingual/bicultural children of immigrants as they enter school and navigate life in the U.S. for their foreign-born relatives. The distinct languages are obvious, the conflicting cultures (collectivist vs. self-reliant), are less so. MariVi's experiences mirror that of many bicultural children and will help others like her navigate their childhood. MariVi will also appeal to all children who have felt as an outsider at some point in their lives.'How refreshing and welcome is the arrival of MariVi.

Space-obsessed 12-year-old Paola Santiago and her two best friends, Emma and Dante, know the rule: Stay away from the river. It's all they've heard since a schoolmate of theirs drowned a year ago. Pao is embarrassed to admit that she has been told to stay away for even longer than that, because her mother is constantly warning her about La Llorona, the wailing ghost woman who wanders the banks of the Gila at night, looking for young people to drag into its murky depths. Hating her mother's humiliating superstitions and knowing that she and her friends would never venture into the water, Pao organizes a meet-up to test out her new telescope near the Gila, since it's the best stargazing spot. But when Emma never arrives and Pao sees a shadowy figure in the reeds, it seems like maybe her mom was right. . . . Pao has always relied on hard science to make sense of the world, but to find her friend she will have to enter the world of her nightmares, which includes unnatural mist, mind-bending monsters, and relentless spirits controlled by a terrifying force that defies both logic and legend.

And he warns that we sacrifice community values for material gain when we incarcerate or marginalize people already on the edge of society.

When a month of overtime shifts comes his way, he begins to envision a new life, one in which he can save enough money for an engagement ring and finally propose to his girlfriend, Joyce. He works the night shift, exhausted but making good money, and it's looking like his plan will work. Then Ana is chased home from the Laundromat by bullies, and she begins pushing him to buy a washer and dryer. Gilbert tries to stay firm, but when Ana's trouble follows her to school, the pressure mounts to put her first, and delay his future with Joyce.\n Joyce, who at thirty-six has never lived on her own, can't move out of her father's traditional Mexican house until she is married. Feeling her life with Gilbert slipping away, she starts to despair. And then one day, standing before her impressive collection of vintage purses, she sees a way to take control of her future. But it won't be easy.\n Writing from three distinct and equally moving perspectives, award-winning author Michael Jaime-Becerra tells a story about the painful balance between love and responsibility.

        "description": "Tal vez tu hijo acaba de decir que su dragón de peluche favorito puede exhalar fuego por la boca. ¿O dice que el mural de lápices de colores de la pared de su dormitorio fue hecho por la mascota de la familia?\n Tal vez afirman que el lodo en la cocina recién limpiada fue puesto allí por... ¡cualquiera o cualquier otra cosa que no sea ellos! Podría haber venido del espacio exterior. .\n Hay muchas investigaciones sobre por qué, cómo y cuándo mienten los niños, pero los padres estarán de acuerdo en que crea una situación desafiante y frustrante. Quieres que sea un momento de enseñanza. Sin embargo, es difícil encontrar el tono correcto, mantener las cosas positivas y sentir que estás llegando a tu hijo. ¡Es difícil enseñar honestidad sin sonar como el comisario local!\n In En Conoce a las sirenas: Hola, soy Sofía, tú y tu hijo conozcan a Sofía, la miembro de las Cinco Sirenas Encantadas a quien le encanta ayudar a los niños a aprender sobre las alegrías y los beneficios de ser honestos. Deje que Sofía sea la guía de su hijo mientras habla suavemente sobre las razones por las que los niños mienten y luego presenta algunas viñetas para ilustrar las diferentes razones. En cada mini historia hay resultados \"felices\" e \"infelices\", que trazan el rango de consecuencias que podría enfrentar un niño cuando se le presentan las opciones de confesar o desviar la culpa de sí mismo. Estos escenarios alternativos pueden ser utilizados para iniciar una conversación entre usted y su hijo. .\n Este libro es una gran adición a la biblioteca de su casa, aula y escuela.\n Conoce a las Sirenas: Hola, soy Sofía es el sexto libro de una serie de libros ilustrados para niños de 3 a 7 años. La serie es una gran referencia para que su hijo aprenda sobre los elementos del desarrollo de la primera infancia en un ambiente amigable, creativo y no amenazante. Si estás buscando historias únicas que ayuden a tu hijo a desarrollar su inteligencia emocional y una mentalidad de crecimiento, ¡estos libros son para ti!",

His voice must have been stolen by the Colorless King, the source of all the world's sorrows -- terrifying, unrelenting, all-taking and never-giving. Now, Ye has no choice but to embark on a long voyage over land and sea, past grizzled pirates, a drunken clown, and more, to find the famous witch who can help him defeat the Colorless King. What he discovers may be a lesson for us all. Young cartoonist Guilherme Petreca won Brazil's prestigious HQ Mix Award for Best Artist due to the unforgettable imagery on every page of Ye, his first full-length graphic novel.

Zane has always enjoyed exploring the dormant volcano near his home in New Mexico, even though hiking it is challenging. He'd much rather hang out there with his dog, Rosie, than go to middle school, where kids call him Sir Limps a Lot, McGimpster, or Uno--for his one good leg. What Zane doesn't know is that the volcano is a gateway to another world and he is at the center of a powerful prophecy. A new girl at school, Brooks, informs him that he's destined to release an evil god from the ancient Maya relic he is imprisoned in--unless she can find and remove it first. Together they return to the volcano, where all kinds of crazy happens. Brooks turns into a hawk, a demon attacks them in a cave, and Rosie gives her all while trying to protect Zane. When Zane decides to save his dog no matter the cost, he is thrust into an adventure full of surprising discoveries, dangerous secrets, and an all-out war between the gods, one of whom happens to be his father. To survive, Zane will have to become the Storm Runner. But how can he run when he can't even walk well without a cane?",

There were eight children at the beginning of Mercado's story, all battling to use a single bathroom and hairbrush. Doris' mother, Lina, worked as a seamstress.

He and the other Mexican American students were told they had to go to a new, separate school. A school just for them. A school where they would not hold back the other students. But Roberto and the other students and their families believed the new school's real purpose was to segregate, to separate. They didn't think that was right, or just, or legal. This historical fiction picture book by Sibert award-winning author Larry Dane Brimner and Pura Belpre award-winning illustrator Maya Gonzalez follows Roberto and the other immigrant families on their journey in 1931 as they battle against separation and prejudice in one of America's landmark segregation cases. \n",

La primera, la difícil, es seguir el orden lineal de la historia, desde el capítulo 1 hasta el final.\n Pero algunos lectores han tenido dificultades para pasar del primer capítulo, porque es algo denso y hay muchas incógnitas. Por eso hay una segunda manera de leer el libro, la manera fácil: comienza a leer por el Capítulo 2, luego el Capítulo 3 y cuando termines de leer el Capítulo 4, lee el Capítulo 1.\n Las dos maneras son correctas y la historia no cambia si la lees en orden o saltando el primer capítulo. ¡Anímate a leer!",

When Vic and his twin sister Tori are forced to move 500 miles away from everything and everyone they've always known, including the grave of Vic's late best friend, Franki, Vic's entire life feels in shambles. In his new home, Vic can't seem to find his footing. His dad and stepmom are trying to buy his affection, his stepsister is a complete brat, and to make matters worse, his twin Tori is fitting in just fine. Vic's loneliness makes him miss Franki even more. One afternoon Vic plays with a science experiment and his abuela's bruja to bring Franki back... only it works! Franki arrives at Pennylane School the next day, and the other kids immediately flock to her. Suddenly Vic and Franki are Pennylane School's coolest new duo. But when Vic starts to lose control of Franki, everything goes awry. Vic is confronted with what it means to bring back the past and the consequences of trying to control the future. As Vic struggles to navigate this confusing new world, he finds himself wondering if he might have been just fine in the present... all on his own.

Su mundo está devastado, pero no todo está perdido. -- Hay algo allá abajo, entre las ramas deshojadas de Madre, en los lindes de su bosque junto a la entrada oriente del valle sagrado. Es lo que queda de ciudades construidas por los carnívoros. No estaban aquí el día que me marché. Entre sus muros demolidos veo piras alimentadas con cuerpos de Pod desmembrados. Un poco más cerca del templo están las máquinas de guerra alineadas. Disparan toda su artillería contra la barrera viva de Madre. Y Madre resiste.

No tiene la intensidad que solía desincentivar a las criaturas que nos amenazaban en el pasado. Del otro lado del cerco y por apenas un instante, veo a un grupo de Pod armados con rocas y lanzas.

Please Stay In Bed is a short book filled with colorful artwork. Although this book doesn't focus on a deep lesson, it is a good toddler book for any parents with young black girls searching for diverse picture books or diverse children short stories.Our African American book briefly jokes about young children and the many questions parents hear from their children when it is time to go to sleep. Please Stay In Bed has vibrant illustrations from a young illustrator with a vision.This is a remix of the our popular picture book, Anna, Stay In Bed!... The story was updated to be an easier read. A few of the big changes in Please Stay In Bed are: simpler words, character names were removed, tone is curious instead of defiant, and bigger font size. [ Anyway, thanks for the support! Hope you enjoy the book. ] \n",

And who knows these treasured institutions better than the cats who run them? (Or at least they think they do!) InBodega Cat, a cat named Chip takes us through his bustling workday at the Matos family's bodega: from receiving boxes in the morning and the breakfast rush, through counting inventory and making deliveries, to dinnertime with his family, when Papi cooks up some of the best Dominican food in the borough for their friends and neighbors. There is no rest for this busy kitty...except for when it's time to chase pigeons with his brother Damian, or to take the occasional nap on the potato chip bags.

Now she’s basking in the spotlight while those “characters” find their very recognizable selves dangling in that same blinding light. But turnabout is fair play, and so here, Yolanda García’s family and friends tell the truth about Yo. Her three sisters, her Mami and Papi, her grandparents, tías, tíos, cousins, housemaids, her third husband: they take turns telling their side of the story, ripping into Yo and in the process creating their own endearing self-portraits.\n At once funny and poignant, intellectual and gossipy, lighthearted and layered, ¡Yo! is above all a portrait of the artist. And with its bright colors, passion, and penchant for controversy, it’s a portrait that could come only from the palette of Julia Alvarez.",

Following a bout with polio at the age of six, Frida Kahlo's life was marked by pain and loneliness. In real life she walked with a limp, but in her dreams she flew. One day her imagination took her on a journey to a girl in white who could dance without pain and hold her secrets, an indelible figure who would find her way into Frida's art in years to come. Inspired by Frida Kahlo's diary, Anthony Browne captures the essence of the artist's early flights of fancy and depicts both Frida and her imaginary friend in vivid illustrations evoking Kahlo's iconic style. A note at the end offers a brief biography of the artist who has intrigued art lovers the world over. \n",

All the young women wanted to marry him because he was rich, powerful, and supposedly very handsome. But to marry the invisible being the women had to prove to his sister that they had seen him. And none had been able to get past the sister's stern, all-knowing gaze. Then came the Rough-Face girl, scarred from working by the fire. Could she succeed where her beautiful, cruel sisters had failed? \n",

Windy can tell such stories herself-about her dog, Itchy Boy, and the way he dances to request a treat and how he wriggles with joy in response to, well, just about everything. When Uncle and Windy Girl and Itchy Boy attend a powwow, Windy watches the dancers in their jingle dresses and listens to the singers. She eats tasty food and joins family and friends around the campfire. Later, Windy falls asleep under the stars. Now Uncle's stories inspire other visions in her head: a bowwow powwow, where all the dancers are dogs. In these magical scenes, Windy sees veterans in a Grand Entry, and a visiting drum group, and traditional dancers, grass dancers, and jingle-dress dancers-all with telltale ears and paws and tails. All celebrating in song and dance. All attesting to the wonder of the powwow. This playful story by Brenda Child is accompanied by a companion retelling in Ojibwe by Gordon Jourdain and brought to life by Jonathan Thunder's vibrant dreamscapes. The result is a powwow tale for the ages. \n",

The book helps to spread a message of belief and pride in yourself and your culture.\n\nThe Journey of the Freckled Indian children's book pushes boundaries because it engages in the conversation of what it means to be Tlingit, Alaska Native and Native American in today's world. The concept of identity is very multi-faceted, and is not necessarily defined by skin color or blood quantum, but by family heritage and a person's involvement in their community. This first Freckled Indian children's book helps introduce children to the topic of identity as it pertains to who they are and where they come from, which is very important in constructing a sense of self-confidence. The book will also allow parents to start a conversation with their children about how the outside world may not always see them for who they are, nevertheless they must stand proud and draw that strength from inside themselves. \nshow more",

The boy grew up to become the painter of the tribe, but although he found a pure white buckskin for a canvas and made paints from the brightest flowers and the reddest berries, he could not capture the sunset. \n\nHow the young Indian artist finally fulfills his Dream-Vision is lovingly told and illustrated by Tomie dePaola, in words and pictures that capture the spirit and beauty of this dramatic legend. \n",

You have family on land as you do in the sea. . . being a caretaker of the earth begins with taking care of the water that all life depends on. Shiny is a whale child. One day his mother teaches him about the harm facing the world's oceans because of human carelessness.

Soft Rain is confident that her family will not have to move, because they have just planted corn for the next harvest but soon thereafter, soldiers arrive to take nine-year-old, Soft Rain, and her mother to walk the Trail of Tears, leaving the rest of her family behind. Because Soft Rain knows some of the white man's language, she soon learns that they must travel across rivers, valleys, and mountains.

The settings in the first part of the book range from the mammoth- and bison-hunting Paleo-Indians of over 11,000 years ago to the various nomadic and agricultural groups encountered by sixteenth-century Spanish explorers. Further drawings reflect changes over the centuries as Indian lifeways were forever altered and often destroyed due to contact with white newcomers who all claimed their land.

The Anasazis' accomplishments--in agriculture, in art, in commerce, in architecture and engineering--were astounding, rivaling those of the Mayans in distant Central America. By the 13th century, however, the Anasazi were gone from Chaco. Vanished. What was it--drought? pestilence? war? forced migration? mass murder or suicide? Craig Childs draws on scholarly research and a lifetime of adventure and exploration in the American Southwest, to pursue the mystery of their disappearance. Considering many possibilities--drought, suicide--he points the way to a new understanding of how a vibrant civilization collapsed.HOUSE OF RAIN is a landmark work in the literature of ancient Native American culture, a key to a fascinating and mysterious lost civilization. \n",

During the beginning years of the American experiment in democracy, American settlers in the new world faced hardships in winning their freedom from the British, only to find other enemies in the west; native Americans who fought to the death to keep their ancestral lands intact and their culture vibrant. Little Turtle found support in his efforts to thwart the ambitions of the invading whites in a most unusual place - white children who became 'Indian' after being abducted and then raised in native American families. Little Turtles' true story includes accounts of his family that included his son and wife, both of white parentage, both who were taken from their white families while they were children. American patriots at the time called Indians savages, but George Washington seemed to have a more balanced view as he first raised an army to battle the Little Turtle confederacy and subsequently served as the host for Little Turtle's visit to the east, showering the Indian war chief with gifts after several pivotal battles.

        "description": "Denise Lajimodiere's interest in American Indian boarding school survivors stories evolved from recording her father and other family members speaking of their experiences. Her research helped her to gain insight, a deeper understanding of her parents, and how and why she and her siblings were parented in the way they were. That insight led her to an emotional ceremony of forgiveness, described in the last chapter of Stringing Rosaries.The journey to record survivors stories led her through the Dakotas and Minnesota and into the personal and private space of boarding school survivors. While there, she heard stories that they had never shared before. She came to an understanding of new terms: historical and intergenerational trauma, soul wound. Stringing Rosaries presents a brief history of the federal boarding school programs for Indigenous Americans, followed by sixteen interviews with boarding school survivors, and ending with the author's own healing journey with her father.Contains 39 black and white photographs, color fold-out supplement identifying 366 US boarding schools by state, appendix, bibliography, and index. \n",

The headline: 'Foster home children beaten - and nobody's helping'.\n\nDorgan, who had been working with American Indian tribes to secure resources, was distressed. He flew to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation to meet with five-year-old Tamara and her grandfather. They became friends. Then she disappeared. And he would search for her for decades until they finally found each other again.\n\nThis book is her story, from childhood to the present, but it's also the story of a people and a nation. More than one in three American Indian/Alaskan Native children live in poverty. AI/AN children are disproportionately in foster care and awaiting adoption. Suicide among AI/AN youth ages 15 to 24 is 2.5 times the national rate. How have we allowed this to happen?show more",

But she soon found herself caught between two worlds--white and Native American. \n\nAt school she missed her mother and her traditional life, but Zitkala-Sa found joy in music classes. My wounded spirit soared like a bird as I practiced the piano and violin, she wrote. Her talent grew, and when she graduated, she became a music teacher, composer, and performer. \n\nZitkala-Sa found she could also sing to help her people by writing stories and giving speeches.

Richly illustrated with original art, they capture a wide range of belief systems and wisdom from the Cherokee, Cheyenne, Hopi, Lenape, Maidu, Seminole, Seneca and other tribes. The beautifully retold tales, all with informative introductions, range from creation myths and animal fables to stirring accounts of bravery and sacrifice. You can find out how stories first came to be and how the People came to the upper world. You can meet Rabbit, the clever and irresistible Creek trickster and see why the Pawnee continue to do the Bear Dance to this day. Stefano Vitale's art showcases a stunning array of animal figures, masks, totems and Navajo-style patterns, in nature's palette of brilliant turquoises, earth browns, shimmering sun-yellow and fire-orange and deep blues of a dark night. \n",

The Chumash, reduced by the 20th century from one of the richest and most populous groups in California to a pitiful remnant, had almost lost their strage and ecstatic mental world by the time John Peabody Harrington set out to collect what was still remembered of their language and oral literature. Working with a handful of ancient informants, Harrington recorded all he could--then, in bitter rejection of the world, kept it hidden and unpublished. After his death there began a great quest for his scattered notes, and these notes are now being published at last. Thomas Blackburn, among the first and most assiduous of the seekers through Harrington's materials, has published her the main body of oral literature that Harrington collected from the Chumash of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties.\nBlackburn has done much more: he has added to the 111 stories a commentary and analysis, almost book-length in its own right, and a glossary of the Chumash and Californian-Spanish terms that Harrington was prone t...show more",

During all this time, they have told stories to each other to explain how things came to be, to pass on lessons about life, and to describe the mountains, animals, plants, and spirits around them. \"\"The Origin of the Milky Way and Other Living Stories of the Cherokee\"\" collects 26 stories that are great for kids and are still being told by storytellers today.Presented by members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in their own words, the stories appear in free-verse form, like poems on the page, so that if you read them aloud, you can hear the rhythm of the stories as they were originally told. Barbara R. Duncan provides a helpful introduction that describes Cherokee people's past and present ways of life and their storytelling traditions. The book also includes a glossary of key words from the stories, suggestions for further reading, and notes on the storytellers. Suitable for young readers, for parents to read aloud to young listeners, and for teachers and libraries, \"\"The Origin of the Milky Way\"\" provides an excellent introduction to Cherokee culture. \n",

First published in 1946, it was used in schools and to teach literacy to adult Navajos. It is dedicated to all children, Navajo and non-Navajo alike. The bold and graphic illustrations by Andrew Tsinajinnie reflect Navajo Life of that era. He was already making a living as an artist at the time and was named an Arizona Living Treasure in 1991 . Native Child Dinetah has colorized the illustrations to introduce a new generation of readers to this great artist and children's book. Starting in the 1930s, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs began publishing many collaborations illustrated by Native Americans and largely penned by Anglo writers as bilingual textbooks . They were the first bilingual materials published on any large scale in this country. This was a time of change. The BIA was just beginning to allow Native Americans to speak their own languages, because until then Congress had mandated total assimilation. So the BIA's bilingual textbooks, published under the rubric of Indian Life Readers, was considered revolutionary. This is such a book. \n",

But most of all he loves to share the special treasures that remind him of his First Nations culture. Perhaps his favourite treasure is the medicine pouch that his grandfather made especially for him. This is where he keeps many of his other treasures, including the sacred herbs his mother gave him. Matthew uses the herbs to remind him to be grateful for everything that nature gives us. Another special gift is the eagle feather from his father. Matthew knows that the eagle is a symbol of the spiritual strength of his culture. But there is one other gift that has a special place in Matthew's heart. It is the dream catcher that Matthew gave to his friend Dustin to help him not have bad dreams. The Sharing Circle is a collection of seven stories about First Nations culture and spiritual practices: The Eagle Feather, The Dream Catcher, The Sacred Herbs, The Talking Circle, The Medicine Wheel, The Drum, and The Medicine Pouch. \n\nResearched and written by Mi'kmaw children's author Theresa Meuse-Dallien, and beautifully illustrated by Mi'kmaw illustrator Arthur Stevens, this book will engage and inform children of all ages. \n",

Sacagawea was the only girl, and the only Native American, to join Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery, which explored the United States from the Mississippi River all the way to the Pacific Ocean in the early 1800s. As a translator, she helped the team communicate with members of the Shoshone tribe across the continent, carrying her child on her back the whole way. By the time the expedition arrived at the west coast, Sacagawea had proved that she truly was a trailblazer. This friendly, fun biography series focuses on the traits that made our heroes great--the traits that kids can aspire to in order to live heroically themselves. Each book tells the story of one of America's icons in a lively, conversational way that works well for the youngest nonfiction readers and that always includes the hero's childhood influences. At the back are an excellent timeline and photos. \n",

Mary was separated from her parents and brothers and sister. She traveled with the Indians to southern Ohio and later to a Seneca village on the Genesee River in what is now western New York. Mary's new life was not easy. She missed her family terribly, and she was unaccustomed to Seneca ways. Several times she even tried to run away. But the Indians were kind to her and taught her many things about the earth, its plants, and its creatures. She became a sister to animals and to all growing things. Then Mary was finally given the chance to return to the world of white men. But she had also become a sister to the Indians. How could she leave them?

When a Spanish boy, Juan Ortiz, is captured by Uleyli's father, she intervenes on his behalf and begins to plot her escape from her village. As she dreams of a new life in Cuba, Uleyli encounters a series of problems that put her dreams at risk. To solve her problems she will need to use the power of her creativity to help save her new friend, her village, and herself.\n\nThis graphic novel was inspired by the true story of a young Native American woman, Ulele, known as Florida's Pocahontas. The beautiful full-color illustrations and simple text paint a picture of life in 16th-century Native American villages in what is now the southeastern United States. This is a story celebrating Ulele's creativity and non-violent heroism.\n\nPerfect for young fans of graphic novels (ages 9 - 12) who are interested in learning more about US hist...show more",

        "description": "The New York Times bestseller and National Book Award finalist Killers of the Flower Moon is now adapted for young readers. This essential book introduces young readers to the Reign of Terror against the Osage people--one of history's most ruthless and shocking crimes. In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma, thanks to the oil that was discovered beneath their land. Then, one by one, the Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances, and anyone who tried to investigate met the same end. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created Bureau of Investigation, which became the FBI, took up the case, one of the organization's first major homicide investigations. An undercover team, including one of the only Native American agents in the bureau, infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest modern techniques of detection. Working with the Osage, they began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history. In this adaptation of the adult bestseller, David Grann revisits his gripping investigation into the shocking crimes against the Osage people. The book is a searing indictment of the callousness and prejudice toward Native Americans that allowed the murderers to occur for so long. \n",

But does that compromise the truth of what really happened? Propaganda has always played a crucial role in turning tides and swaying opinion, and in few places is that more pronounced than in the wholesale slaughter of the native peoples in both North and South America. When some of the people of European descent could not get what they wanted from the Native Americans, they would demonize or dehumanize them so that the American people would clamor for government intervention. This is, for example, evident by analyzing Andrew Jackson's speech to Congress on Indian removal where he would refer to the Native Americans as savages.

To capture the enormous challenges Indians confronted, Steven W. Hackel integrates textual and quantitative sources and weaves together analyses of disease and depopulation, marriage and sexuality, crime and punishment, and religious, economic, and political change. As colonization reduced their numbers and remade California, Indians congregated in missions, where they forged communities under Franciscan over-sight. Yet, missions proved disastrously unhealthful and coercive, as Franciscans sought control over Indians' beliefs and instituted unfamiliar systems of labor and punishment. Even so, remnants of Indian groups still survived when Mexican officials ended Franciscan rule in the 1830s. Many regained land and found strength in ancestral cultures that predated the Spaniards' arrival. At this study's heart are the dynamic interactions in and around Mission San Carlos Borromeo between Monterey region Indians (the Children of Coyote) and Spanish missionaries, soldiers, and settlers. Hackel places these local developments in the context of the California mission system, a...show more",

Founded by the Presbyterian missionaries on the Cattaraugus Seneca Reservation in western New York, the Thomas Asylum for Orphan and Destitute Indian Children, as it was formally named, shared many of the characteristics of the government-operated Indian schools. However, its students were driven to its doors not by Indian agents, but by desperation. Forcibly removed from their land, Iroquois families suffered from poverty, disease, and disruptions in their traditional ways of life, leaving behind many abandoned children. \n\nThe story of the Thomas Indian School is the story of the Iroquois people and the suffering and despair of the children who found themselves trapped in an institution from which there was little chance for escape. Although the school began as a refuge for children, it also served as a mechanism for \"\"civilizing\"\" and converting native children to Christianity. As the school's population swelled and financial support dried up, the founders were forced...show more",

        "description": "Much has been written about pre-war France, but works written through the eyes of a child deserve critical attention. For many Frenchmen living through the German occupation, the War was tragic and filled with daily hardship that had no equal. A CHILD OF SILENCE tells the story of a family ripped apart by the German invasion, a mother trying desperately to survive, a father sent to fight a doomed battle, and an innocent girl torn from home and security to land in a Catholic orphanage. Written in 1953 and kept secret for more than forty years, A CHILD OF SILENCE reveals truths the Church would prefer not be known, and a true story about a child who kept faith in herself despite unimaginable odds. Ms. Fautrel was born in Paris. She spent the War years in Normandy. After the War, Françoise went to Switzerland, and at nearly twenty-one she moved to England. Her mantra was \"work, work, work,\" and after a difficult start, she was able to study and acquire respected professional qualifications. From the 1960s onward she wrote and translated professional articles. Her first book, A CHILD OF SILENCE was published in 1995. This work has been translated into French under the title of TAIS TOI...ET PRI. Francoise's second autobiographical account, THE UNWISE MONKEY, was published in 2011. \n",

The Osages: Children of the Middle Waters is such a book. Drawing from the oral history of his people before the coming of Europeans, the recorded history since, and his own lifetime among them, John Joseph Mathews created a truly epic history.\n\nThis account of the Osages, a Siouan tribe once centered in the area now occupied by St. Louis, later on small streams in southwestern Missouri and southeastern Kansas, then in northeastern Oklahoma, is a spiritual one. Their quest in the centuries-long record was for the meaning of Wah'Kon-Tah, the Great Mysteries. In war, in peace, in camps and villages, in their land of the Middle Waters, the Osages met all of the changes and hardships people are likely to meet anywhere.\nshow more",

Drawings and short descriptions make clear the proper positions and motions of the hands to convey the meaning of over 870 alphabetically arranged common words -- hungry, camp, evening, angry, fire, laugh, owl, cat, many times, brave, cold, heart, rain, spotted, together, river, etc. The words are then used in sample sentences. There are also brief sections on the pictography and ideography of the Sioux and Ojibway tribes, and on smoke signals.\nThis is a book for anyone who wants to learn or teach Indian sign language -- scouts, school teachers, camp counselors, scout leaders, parents, linguists, and students of Indian culture.

Their stories are as diverse as they are. From a young Dene woman pursuing a MBA at Stanford to a Pima photographer in Phoenix to a Mohawk actress in New York, these urban Natives share their unique perspectives to bridge the divide between their past and their future, their cultural home, and their adopted cities. Unflinchingly honest and deeply moving, contributors explore a wide-range of topics. From the trials and tribulations of dating in the city to the alienating experience of leaving a remote reserve to attend high school in the city, from the mainstream success of Electric Pow wow music to the humiliation of dealing with racist school mascots, personal perspectives illuminate larger political issues. An innovative and highly visual design offers a dynamic, reading experience. \n",

        "description": "The last 'Indian War' was fought against Native American children in the dormitories and classrooms of government boarding schools. Only by removing Indian children from their homes for extended periods of time, policymakers reasoned, could white \"civilization\" take root while childhood memories of 'savagism' gradually faded to the point of extinction. In the words of one official: 'Kill the Indian and save the man.'\n\nThis fully revised edition of Education for Extinction offers the only comprehensive account of this dispiriting effort, and incorporates the last twenty-five years of scholarship. Much more than a study of federal Indian policy, this book vividly details the day-to-day experiences of Indian youth living in a 'total institution' designed to reconstruct them both psychologically and culturally. The assault on identity came in many forms: the shearing off of braids, the assignment of new names, uniformed drill routines, humiliating punishments, relentless attacks on native religious beliefs, patriotic indoctrinations, suppression of tribal languages, Victorian gender rituals, football contests, and industrial training.show more",

        "description": "The first people in the New World were few, their encampments fleeting. On a side of the planet no human had ever seen, different groups arrived from different directions, and not all at the same time. The land they reached was fully inhabited by megafauna--mastodons, giant bears, mammoths, saber-toothed cats, enormous bison, and sloths that stood one story tall. These Ice Age explorers, hunters, and families were wildly outnumbered and many would themselves have been prey to the much larger animals. In Atlas of a Lost World, Craig Childs blends science and personal narrative to upend our notions of where these people came from and who they were. How they got here, persevered, and ultimately thrived is a story that resonates from the Pleistocene to our modern era, and reveals how much has changed since the time of mammoth hunters, and how little. Through it, readers will see the Ice Age, and their own age, in a whole new light. \n",

Inspired by President Barack Obama's Of Thee I Sing, Go Show the World is a tribute to historic and modern-day Indigenous heroes, featuring important figures such as Tecumseh, Sacagawea and former NASA astronaut John Herrington. Celebrating the stories of Indigenous people throughout time, Wab Kinew has created a powerful rap song, the lyrics of which are the basis for the text in this beautiful picture book, illustrated by the acclaimed Joe Morse. Including figures such as Crazy Horse, Net-no-kwa, former NASA astronaut John Herrington and Canadian NHL goalie Carey Price, Go Show the World showcases a diverse group of Indigenous people in the US and Canada, both the more well known and the not- so-widely recognized. Individually, their stories, though briefly touched on, are inspiring; collectively, they empower the reader with this message: We are people who matter, yes, it's true; now let's show the world what people who matter can do. \n",

The Ancient Child juxtaposes Indian lore and Wild West legend into a hypnotic, often lyrical contemporary novel. It is the story of Locke Setman, known as Set, a Native American raised far from the reservation by his adoptive father. Set feels a strange aching in his soul and, returning to tribal lands for the funeral of his grandmother, is drawn irresistibly to the fabled bear-boy. When he meets Grey, a beautiful young medicine woman with a visionary gift, his world is turned upside down.

Ádahoonílígíí was published by the Navajo Agency of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Window Rock, Arizona and contributed to the standardization of Navajo orthography. The only widely available texts intended for a Navajo audience up to that point had been religious publications and parts of Diyin God Bizaad - the Bible. The paper was edited by Robert W. Young and William Morgan, Sr. whose task it was to create a simplified Navajo alphabet with Roman letters found on an English typewriter keyboard.They write in the introduction: \"We have endeavored to select the best of these historical accounts, to publish them bilingually in the present volume, and it is our hope that they may be of interest to all persons and students of Navajo history.\" We find stories about the traditional Navajo country-about the Four Sacred Mountains and how the clans were created, as well as a story about Navajo scouts on the trail of Geronimo.

But her birth family is a strange brood and meeting them is not the happy reunion she expected. It’s only when Molly finds a letter from her late father that she comes to realize how much danger she’s in—and what it will take to escape the shadows of Mountfort Hall alive.\n\n The Red Carnelian: Linell Wynn, copywriter for Chicago department store Cunningham’s, can put a clever spin on everything. But she’s at a loss for words when, after closing time, she finds the manager’s corpse in a window display. Considering her volatile history with the victim, she’s the number one suspect—until a second murder throws the store detective for a loop and plunges Linell into the investigation.

But there were some--a handful of Jesuit missionaries--who came not to get, but to give. They wished to give the savage Indians the knowledge of God and of His love for them. One of these missionaries was Isaac Jogues, martyr and Saint. This is the story of his dangerous and difficult life among the Indian tribes in their tree-dark country--of his work of conversion, of his efforts to teach the Indians rules of health and to set them free from their superstitious belief in the power of their medicine men. This is the inspiring story of his enslavement by the Mohawks, his daring escape, and finally, his death as a martyr for the Faith. \n",

The hair on their chins is hair of the people they use to eat...It is Terrible to think about those times... \nBut the Creator saw the people's distress and decreed that a contest be held between all the two-legged and four-legged creatures. Who would win, thundering Buffalo or fleet-footed Man? None of the other animals was fast enough, and before the end, Beaver and Muskrat slipped off into a cool stream, Jack-rabbit hopped off across the plain, and Mole and Gopher tunneled underground (and may still think the race is on). \nThe winner was decided long ago, in Sioux and Cheyenne legend. Buffalo -- who lost -- agreed to give up eating men for dinner, and thanks to the cunning of a single magpie, Man became the guardian of the natural world. \n",

Disclosing his story through flashbacks and relying on research from his own case files, Razor pieces together the shattered fragments of his boyhood into a memoir that reads as compellingly as a novel. \n\nAbandoned as an infant at the State Public School in Owatonna, Minnesota, Peter Razor is raised by abusive workers who thought of him as nothing more than \"a dirty Injun.\" Cut off from his family and his heritage, he turns inward, forced to learn about the world on his own. After failed attempts to run away from the orphanage, he is indentured by the state to an abusive, reclusive farm family. Beaten, poorly fed, clothed in rags, and worked like slave labor, he struggles to attend high school and begins to dream of another life. Razor's stark and often chilling story, devoid of self-pity, recalls with haunting clarity the years he, like the locust, patiently waited to awaken and emerge. \n",

        "description": "Separating truth from tall tales, this easy-to-read biography details the life of a great American frontiersman. Legends say Davy Crockett weighed two hundred pounds when he was born, and leapt right out of his cradle ready to fight. Though those stories are an exagerration, Crockett's life was anything but boring. Farmer, soldier, sharp-shooter and politician, he was a well-known figure in the early 1800s--and even after his death, his reputation as an American folk hero grew and grew. In this illustrated biography, David Adler retells the true story of David Crockett's life--from his birth in Tennessee to his death at the Alamo. Using contemporary primary sources, Adler distinguishes between fact and legend, providing details about Crockett's family life and political career, as well as a note about the historical origins of many of the famed tall tales. A timeline of important dates is included. For almost thirty years, David Adler's Picture Book Biography series has profiled famous people who changed the world. Colorful, kid-friendly illustrations combine with Adler's \"expert mixtures of facts and personality\" (Booklist) to introduce young readers to history through compelling biographies of presidents, heroes, inventors, explorers, and adventurers. These books are ideal for first and second graders interested in history or who need reliable sources for school book reports. \n",

She is the darkest-skinned among them and therefore the ugliest in her mother, Rozelle's, estimation, but she's also the brightest. Rozelle--beautiful, charismatic, and light-skinned--exercises a violent hold over her children. Fearing abandonment, she pulls them from school at the age of twelve and sends them to earn their keep for the household, whether in domestic service, in the fields, or at \"the farmhouse\" on the edge of town, where Rozelle beds local men for money. But Tangy Mae has been selected to be part of the first integrated class at a nearby white high school.

A President Obama O Book Club pick\n\nRaised in South Carolina and New York, Woodson always felt halfway home in each place. In vivid poems, she shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s, living with the remnants of Jim Crow and her growing awareness of the Civil Rights movement. Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child's soul as she searches for her place in the world. Woodson's eloquent poetry also reflects the joy of finding her voice through writing stories, despite the fact that she struggled with reading as a child. Her love of stories inspired her and stayed with her, creating the first sparks of the gifted writer she was to become.

Eleven-year-old Delphine is like a mother to her two younger sisters, Vonetta and Fern. She's had to be, ever since their mother, Cecile, left them seven years ago for a radical new life in California.

MaVynee loved going to the beach. But in the days of Jim Crow, she couldn't just go to any beach--most of the beaches in Jacksonville were for whites only. Knowing something must be done, her grandfather bought a beach that African American families could enjoy without being reminded they were second class citizens; he called it American Beach. Artists like Zora Neale Hurston and Ray Charles vacationed on its sunny shores. It's here that MaVynee was first inspired to sing, propelling her to later become a widely acclaimed opera singer who routinely performed on an international stage. But her first love would always be American Beach. After the Civil Rights Act desegregated public places, there was no longer a need for a place like American Beach and it slowly fell into disrepair. MaVynee remembered the importance of American Beach to her family and so many others, so determined to preserve this integral piece of American history, she began her second act as an activist and conservationist, ultimately saving the place that had always felt most like home \n",

She knew from Granddaddy Zak's stories that Juneteenth celebrated the day the freedom news of President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation finally sailed into Texas in 1865--over two years after the president had declared it! But Opal didn't always see freedom in her Texas town. Then one Juneteenth day when Opal was twelve years old, an angry crowd burned down her brand-new home. This wasn't freedom at all. She had to do something! Opal Lee spent the rest of her life speaking up for equality and unity. She became a teacher, a charity worker, and a community leader.

This collection includes the first three books in the series—a perfect gift for the Faithgirlz in your life!\n\n In Reaching for the Stars, Lena Daniels knows there’s nothing else she’d rather do than be in the movies. But now that she's gotten her wish, Lena finds that being in the spotlight is harder than it sounds. With her face plastered everywhere, Lena wonders if this is a dream come true or a horrible nightmare. With her little sisters, Ansley, Ashton, and Amber, constantly at her side, Lena must face the challenges of everyday life while chasing her dreams of being an actress. Lena tackles challenges, learns the value of perseverance, keeps her hopes high, and trusts faith and family to get her through.\n\n In Shining Night, Lena’s overnight fame continues to pull her into the spotlight, but now she’s faced with her biggest challenge yet. Lena learns that a new friend she met at a recent visit to the children’s hospital needs help. The hospital is closing and the little girl’s parents can’t afford the ongoing care she needs. Rallying the support of her school, friends, and family, Lena pulls together a huge concert to raise funds. She discovers that helping others comes at a cost, but what matters most in life cannot be bought. With the encouragement and mentoring she receives from her family, Lena is reminded that God is her strength and his plan is bigger.\n\n In Day Dreams and Movie Screens, Lena Daniels’ summer of Hollywood starlets and movie filming alongside her favorite singer, Mallory Winston, is over. School will soon be back in full swing, but just as she begins to wonder if her summer was all just a dream, Lena’s world is turned upside down. The movie premiers, the previews seem to be splattered on every television and radio channel, and everyone knows her name. Lena is just figuring out how to manage her new fame at home when she finds out she’s hitting the road on a two-week bus tour to further promote the film. Lena experiences adventures and challenges she never expected, while learning to step outside of her comfort zone and follow the path God has for her life.",

        "description": "Discover the incredible story of a young daughter of immigrants who would grow up to be the first woman, first Black person, and first South Asian American ever elected Vice President of the United States in this moving picture book biography of Kamala Harris.\n\nWhen Kamala Harris was young, she often accompanied her parents to civil rights marches-so many, in fact, that when her mother asked a frustrated Kamala what she wanted, the young girl responded with: \"Freedom!\"\n\nAs Kamala grew from a small girl in Oakland to a senator running for president, it was this long-fostered belief in freedom and justice for all people that shaped her into the inspiring figure she is today. From fighting for the use of a soccer field in middle school to fighting for the people of her home state in Congress, Senator Harris used her voice to speak up for what she believed in and for those who were otherwise unheard. And now this dedication has led her all the way to being elected Vice President of the United States.show more",

        "description": "100 Things Every Black Girl Should Know is the quintessential collection of invaluable advice designed specifically for you, the young black girl trying to navigate her way through life, as well-seasoned woman looking to brush up on the essentials. This lighthearted but serious gem of a book has made an impact on various races (in testing), but the author wrote it from her perspective as a black woman who was once a young girl who wishes she knew then what she knows now. Since that isn't possible, she has compiled some of her best and hardest lessons into ten chapters that each include ten \"things you should know\", ranging from oral care to the inevitability of heartbreak. This book is intended to spark conversations and change the narrative between sister-friends, mothers and daughters, and womankind, alike. \n\nVisit www.

It is, in other words, the key to reshaping our very lives.\"--Oprah Winfrey This book is going to change the way you see your life. Have you ever wondered Why did I do that? or Why can't I just control my behavior? Others may judge our reactions and think, What's wrong with that person?

Now, her mama always told her that if she wanted something, \"to jump at de sun\", because even though you might not land quite that high, at least you'd get off the ground. So Zora jumped from place to place, from the porch of the general store where she listened to folktales, to Howard University, to Harlem. And everywhere she jumped, she shined sunlight on the tales most people hadn't been bothered to listen to until Zora. The tales no one had written down until Zora. Tales on a whole culture of literature overlooked...until Zora. Until Zora jumped. \n",

At the turn of the nineteenth century, good children's books about black life were hard to find - if, indeed, young black readers and their parents could even gain entry into the bookstores and libraries. But today, in the \"Golden Age\" of African-American children's picturebooks, one can find a wealth of titles ranging from Happy to be Nappy to Black is Brown is Tan. In this book, Michelle Martin explores how the genre has evolved from problematic early works such as Epaminondas that were rooted in minstrelsy and stereotype, through the civil rights movement, and onward to contemporary celebrations of blackness. She demonstrates the cultural importance of contemporary favorites through keen historical analysis - scrutinizing the longevity and proliferation of the Coontown series and Ten Little Niggers books, for example - that makes clear how few picturebooks existed in which black children could see themselves and their people positively represented even up until the 1960s. Martin also explores how children's authors and illustrators have addressed major issues in black life and history including racism, the civil rights movement, black feminism, major historical figures, religion, and slavery.

It's a book your children will cherish for the rest of their lives.\n It has received rave editorial reviews and won multiple awards like the 2021 INTERNATIONAL BOOK AWARDS, Children's Mind/Soul/Body category, and Reader Views' GRAND PRIZE - Best Fiction.\n Life of a Firefly is already becoming a classic children's book. It's warm, it's exciting, it's captivating and most of all - KIDS LOVE IT!\n\n \"I have a daughter who absolutely loved to read this! I love how quick-witted and courageous Sandy is. THIS BOOK NEEDS TO BE IN EVERY ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL LIBRARY!\" --Megan B. Joseph, MHA\n \"I can't even express how much I LOVED this book. It's one of the best books I've read in the past decade!\" --Ms. Allison, Editor Book Editing Services\n\n In this award winning children's book Sandy learns to face her giants with the help of a tiny firefly. It builds strong character and help boost self esteem. Kids see themselves in almost every situation that Sandy finds herself in, as she and her firefly go on amazing adventures that captures the imagination. As she continues on her incredible journey, each person she encounters teaches another lesson about friendship and family.\n This beautiful collection of moral stories will remind children, no matter how bleak a situation may look, a little faith and a firefly, can take them a long way. It also gives children of color a mirror of strong characters that look like them, and others a window to experience the African American community in a whole new way.\n\n \"It's a book that parents and librarians should put in the hands of young readers. ... Life of a Firefly is funny, uplifting, and, according to the author, ninety-eight per cent true.\"\n --Ruth Latta, Reviewer for the Compulsive Reader and CM Magazine\n \"... a compelling adventure indeed; worthy not just of leisure pursuit, but family and school discussion. It's very highly recommended reading.\"\n --Diane C. Donovan, Midwest Book Review, Senior Reviewer Donovan's Literary Services\n \"Chapter seven is just hilarious! It made me laugh out loud.\n --Lyzette Wanzer, Creative Writing Instructor, Author, Coach\n\n I can't even express how much I LOVED this book. Usually in a full calendar year I come across one or two books (if I'm lucky) that really stand out. Yours is one of those books. In fact,it's one of the best books I've read in the past decade. If you think about all the books that are published and sitting on shelves, and the small percentage that actually do make it to a best-seller list, maybe this will put things into perspective in what I'm trying to say about how special your book is. I really, truly mean that this book is exceptional, and it can stand out among all of its competitors. You have a gift of storytelling, and it's a magical thing to read and experience! I loved every moment of this story, and Sandy is the perfect protagonist. I have no doubt that your readers will love this story!\n --Ms. Allison, Editor with Book Editing Services\n\n Several times, I found myself laughing at Sandy's antics and responses. This was a beautiful tale that will remind children that no matter how bleak a situation may look, a little faith, or a firefly, can take them a long way.This book needs to be in every elementary and middle school library in the US! Not only does it give black children a chance to read books with strong characters who look like them, it also helps to humanize the black community to those outside of it. Well done!\n --Megan B.

When two adventurous cousins accidentally extend the last day of summer by freezing time, they find the secrets hidden between the unmoving seconds, minutes, and hours are not the endless fun they expected. Otto and Sheed are the local sleuths in their zany Virginia town, masters of unraveling mischief using their unmatched powers of deduction. And as the summer winds down and the first day of school looms, the boys are craving just a little bit more time for fun, even as they bicker over what kind of fun they want to have. That is, until a mysterious man appears with a camera that literally freezes time. Now, with the help of some very strange people and even stranger creatures, Otto and Sheed will have to put aside their differences to save their town - and each other - before time stops for good.

Feeling different made her feel sad. Penny's mom assured her that her hair is perfect. Just because her hair is different from her friends hair, it didn't mean that it was bad. Penny's mom decides to style her hair in puffballs, magic puffballs. Penny learns though a series of fun adventures, that wonderful and magical things happen when she wears her puffballs. Join Penny as she discovers the magic of her puffballs. Message from the author: Penny was born out of my love for my daughter, Paris, and my desire for her to feel comfortable, confident and secure in her skin. Paris questioned why her hair was different from all of the other girls' and wondered why she couldn't wear her hair like theirs. I wanted her to understand that her hair was different but that different didn't mean bad. One night, I made up a bedtime story about a little girl named Penny who had magic puffballs in her hair. Both my daughter and my son loved it so much that they wanted to hear about Penny every night. To keep it interesting, each night I added a different adventure, and from time to time I introduced additional characters. The kids loved these stories so much that Penny became a staple in our bedtime routine. I ended up with more than 30...show more",

        "description": "A challenge to the cultural tradition of corporal punishment in Black homes and its connections to racial violence in America Why do so many African Americans have such a special attachment to whupping children? Studies show that nearly 80 percent of black parents see spanking, popping, pinching, and beating as reasonable, effective ways to teach respect and to protect black children from the streets, incarceration, encounters with racism, or worse. However, the consequences of this widely accepted approach to child-rearing are far-reaching and seldom discussed. Dr. Stacey Patton's extensive research suggests that corporal punishment is a crucial factor in explaining why black folks are subject to disproportionately higher rates of school suspensions and expulsions, criminal prosecutions, improper mental health diagnoses, child abuse cases, and foster care placements, which too often funnel abused and traumatized children into the prison system. Weaving together race, religion, history, popular culture, science, policing, psychology, and personal testimonies, Dr. Patton connects what happens at home to what happens in the streets in a way that is thought-provoking, unforgettable, and deeply sobering. Spare the Kids is not just a book. It is part of a growing national movement to provide positive, nonviolent discipline practices to those rearing...show more",

She was a musical wonder--studying and performing on the piano from the time she was a child. She became an accomplished singer as well, and appeared in Broadway musicals, films, and recorded her own albums. She also made headlines by standing up for the rights of women and African Americans, and she refused to play for segregated audiences. When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led the March on Washington, Hazel led a march in Paris, where she was living, in front of the American Embassy. She learned about the Bahá'í Faith from Dizzy Gillespie and became a Bahá'í on December 1, 1968. She passed away in 1981. We invite you to learn more about this \"Change Maker\" and the enduring impact she had on race relations through her performing arts. \n",

Behind every bad boy is a story worth hearing and at least one chance for redemption. It's 1946 and Lymon, uprooted from his life in the Deep South and moved up North, needs that chance. Lymon's father is, for the time being, at Parchman Farm--the Mississippi State Penitentiary--and his mother, whom he doesn't remember all that much, has moved North. Fortunately, Lymon is being raised by his loving grandparents. Together, Lymon and his grandpops share a love of music, spending late summer nights playing the guitar. But Lymon's world as he knows it is about to dissolve. He will be sent on a journey to two Northern cities far from the country life he loves--and the version of himself he knows. In this companion novel to the Coretta Scott King Honor wining Finding Langston, readers will see a new side of the bully Lymon in this story of an angry boy whose raw talent, resilience, and devotion to music help point him in a new direction.

Though their African American fathers had brought liberation from Nazi tyranny at the end of World War II, they were in a segregated American military derived from a racially divided American society. \n\nDecades later, some of their children could finally know of a father's identity and the life he had led after the war. Just one would be able to find an embrace in his arms, and just one would arrive at her father's American grave after 73 years. But they could now understand their own Dutch lives in the context of their fathers' lives in America. This book relates their experiences, offering fresh insight into the history of American race relations. \n",

She studies anatomy books to get a twelve-year head start on medical school, and she idolizes Leonardo da Vinci. But things go haywire when her spoiled cousin Tiffany comes to visit. At first Brenda tries to ignore Tiffany's constant bragging. But when Tiffany implies that Brenda is not cultured enough to know who Miss Camilla Freeman is--Miss Camilla Freeman, the very famous prima ballerina--Brenda snaps. She tells Tiffany that not only does she know who Camilla Freeman is, but she happens to own an autographed pair of her toeshoes. So of course, Tiffany wants to see the shoes. The only problem? The shoes actually belong to Ms. Debbé, the headmistress of the Nutcracker School! Brenda's anatomy books might get her into medical school, but they can't get her out of this mess--for that, she'll need the help of her Sugar Plum Sisters! \n",

        "description": "Until recently, scholars believed that African American children's literature did not exist before 1900. Now, Who Writes for Black Children? opens the door to a rich archive of largely overlooked literature read by black children. This volume's combination of analytic essays, bibliographic materials, and primary texts offers alternative histories for early African American literary studies and children's literature studies.From poetry written by a slave for a plantation school to joyful \"death biographies\"of African Americans in the antebellum North to literature penned by African American children themselves, Who Writes for Black Children? presents compelling new definitions of both African American literature and children's literature. Editors Katharine Capshaw and Anna Mae Duane bring together a rich collection of essays that argue for children as an integral part of the nineteenth-century black community and offer alternative ways to look at the relationship between children and adults. Including two bibliographic essays that provide a list of texts for future research as well as an extensive selection of hard-to-find primary texts, Who Writes for Black Children? broadens our ideas of authorship, originality, identity, and political formations. In the process, the volume adds new texts to the canon of African American literature while providing a fresh perspective o...show more",

With signature precision of language, and glittering, devastating detail on the page--and never without touches of rich, honest humor--Adichie weaves together her own experience of her father's death with threads of his life story, from his remarkable survival during the Biafran war, through a long career as a statistics professor, into the days of the pandemic in which he'd stay co...show more",

While all the girls who participated in the two-year study are African American, their lives are racialized and gendered in significantly different ways, in both public and private spaces. Affluence is not a guaranteed protection against the identity-damaging effects of racism, and poverty is not necessarily a risk factor for an irresolute identity. By examining identity through the lens of class, Walker provides researchers, educators, and parents a more in-depth appreciation of what is a very complex, multi-layered phenomenon. \n",

Approaching every awkward, taboo, and uncomfortable question with openness and patience, Emmanuel Acho connects his own experience with race and racism--from attending majority-white prep schools to his time in the NFL playing on majority-black football teams--to insightful lessons in black history and black culture. \nUncomfortable Conversations with a Black Boy is just one way young readers can begin to short circuit racism within their own lives and communities. \n",

        "description": "Meet three inspirational figures from Black culture and history: Maya Angelou, Martin Luther King Jr., and Rosa Parks! This boxed gift set of three hardcover books from the internationally best-selling Little People, BIG DREAMS series introduces little dreamers to the lives of these leaders and trailblazers who stepped up and changed the world. In these remarkable true stories, learn how three people stood against injustice and fought for their dream of a better world. Maya overcame her trauma to tell the story of being Black in America, becoming one of the century's most influential and visionary writers. Martin grew up in the harsh world of segregation, and came to show the world that the best weapon against hate is love. Rosa took a stand against what she knew was wrong, igniting a movement that sought to unite a divided world. Each of these moving books features stylish and quirky illustrations and extra facts at the back, including a biographical timeline with historical photos and a detailed profile of the figure's life. \n",

A young Black girl lifts her baby hands up to greet the sun, reaches her hands up for a book on a high shelf, and raises her hands up in praise at a church service. She stretches her hands up high like a plane's wings and whizzes down a hill so fast on her bike with her hands way up. As she grows, she lives through everyday moments of joy, love, and sadness. And when she gets a little older, she joins together with her family and her community in a protest march, where they lift their hands up together in resistance and strength. \n",

        "description": "In this Pulitzer Prize-winning, New York Times bestselling follow-up to The Underground Railroad, Colson Whitehead brilliantly dramatizes another strand of American history through the story of two boys unjustly sentenced to a hellish reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida. When Elwood Curtis, a black boy growing up in 1960s Tallahassee, is unfairly sentenced to a juvenile reformatory called the Nickel Academy, he finds himself trapped in a grotesque chamber of horrors. Elwood's only salvation is his friendship with fellow \"delinquent\" Turner, which deepens despite Turner's conviction that Elwood is hopelessly naive, that the world is crooked, and that the only way to survive is to scheme and avoid trouble. As life at the Academy becomes ever more perilous, the tension between Elwood's ideals and Turner's skepticism leads to a decision whose repercussions will echo down the decades. Based on the real story of a reform school that operated for 111 years and warped the lives of thousands of children, The Nickel Boys is a devastating, driven narrative that showcases a great American novelist writing at the height of his powers and \"should further cement Whitehead as one of his generation's best (Entertainment Weekly). Look for Colson Whitehead's new novel, Harlem Shuffle, coming this September! \n",

It is my intentions for parents and teachers to read along with kids and explain any difficulties they may run across. This book will not only raise awareness but it will also raise self-esteem. Something that is important for early child development. In order to achieve a high status or an important figure in life, you must first believe it is possible. Too many kids are dropping out of school, being incarcerated, becoming addicted to illegal substances or just giving up on life. Many have been disenfranchised. One of the Great Kings in this book is Mansa Musa (Emperor of Mali). Mansa Musa is known as the richest man of all time. In today's standards, he would be worth 400 billion dollars. He built some of the most prestigious colleges in the world at the time he was Emperor. Can you imagine the impact on a child's mind if he were told a black man, or better put, an African man was the richest man of all time. This information could have an extraordinary impact on the success of a child's future. I think this book should be part of the curriculum. \n",

Rochelle was immediately smitten. She was so proud to see this little girl so powerfully honor the struggle and achievement of women several decades her senior. Rochelle reached out to Lola's mom, Cristi Smith-Jones, and asked to pair her writing with Smith-Jones's incredible photographs for a book. The goal? To teach children on the cusp of puberty that they could be anything they aspired to be, that every famous person was once a child who, in some cases, overcame great obstacles to achieve. That They Lived: African Americans Who Changed the World features Riley's grandson, Caleb, and Lola photographed in timeless black and white, dressed as important individuals such as business owners, educators, civil rights leaders, and artists, alongside detailed biographies that begin with the figures as young children who had the same ambitions, fears, strengths, and obstacles facing them that readers today may still experience.

In these beloved stories, morsels rich with the gritty essence of Africa, we meet, among many others, a Kenyan lion named Simba, a snake with seven heads and a trickster from Zulu folklore; we hear the voices of the scheming hyena and learn from a Khoi fable how animals acquired their tails and horns. Several creation myths tell us how the land, its animals, and its people all came into existence under a punishing sun or against the backdrop of a spectacularly beautiful mountain landscape. Whether warning children about the dangers of disobedience or demonstrating that the underdog can--and often does--win, these stories, through their depiction of wise animals as well as evil monsters, are universal in their portrayal of humanity, beasts, and the mystical.\n\nWhat is particularly exciting about this book is that many of the stories, in their oral form, are almost as old as Africa itself. Most of them were, in fact, first told in various African tongues around evening fires in centuries p...show more",

As parents, the best thing we can do is help our kids find their inner strength to develop the skills to learn new things and conquer new challenges.\n\n In this delightful children's mermaid picture book \"Meet the Mermaids: Hi, I’m Zari\", your child meets Zari, a black mermaid, and one of the multi-ethnic Five Enchanted Mermaids, who loves to help kids learn new skills, gain independence and become more self reliant. She encourages young children to learn about all the fun things they can do, if they’re willing to try.  In this mermaid book for girls 3-7, Zari speaks directly to your child, helps calm their fears and breaks it all down by showing them what age appropiate tasks other kids just like them are trying. \n\n This hardcover mermaid book for kids makes learning fun and easy and is a great addition to your home, classroom or school library.

The shake-shake of maracas vibrates down to my toes. \nTi Gran's feet tap-tap to the rhythm. Every year, Haitians all over the world ring in the new year by eating a special soup, a tradition dating back to the Haitian Revolution. This year, Ti Gran is teaching Belle how to make the soup -- Freedom Soup -- just like she was taught when she was a little girl. Together, they dance and clap as they prepare the holiday feast, and Ti Gran tells Belle about the history of the soup, the history of Belle's family, and the history of Haiti, where Belle's family is from. In this celebration of cultural traditions passed from one generation to the next, Jacqueline Alcántara's lush illustrations bring to life both Belle's story and the story of the Haitian Revolution. Tami Charles's lyrical text, as accessible as it is sensory, makes for a tale that readers will enjoy to the last drop. \n",

If you ask her, Alma Sofia Esperanza José Pura Candela has way too many names: six! How did such a small person wind up with such a large name? Alma turns to Daddy for an answer and learns of Sofia, the grandmother who loved books and flowers; Esperanza, the great-grandmother who longed to travel; José, the grandfather who was an artist; and other namesakes, too. As she hears the story of her name, Alma starts to think it might be a perfect fit after all -- and realizes that she will one day have her own story to tell.

        "description": "A Kirkus Reviews most anticipated picture book of fall 2019 by Nadia L. Hohn, named one of CBC's \"6 Black Canadian writers to watch\" Louise Bennett Coverley, better known as Miss Lou, was an iconic poet and entertainer known for popularizing the use of patois in music and poetry internationally--helping to pave the way for artists like Harry Belafonte and Bob Marley to use patois in their work. This picture book tells the story of Miss Lou's early years, when she was a young girl growing up in Jamaica. As a child, Miss Lou loved words--particularly the Jamaican English, or patois, that she heard all around her. As a young writer, Miss Lou felt caught between writing \"lines of words like tight cornrows,\" as her teachers instructed, and words that beat more naturally \"in time with her heart.\" The uplifting and inspiring story of a girl finding her own voice, this is also a vibrant, colorful, and immersive look at an important figure in our cultural history. With rich and warm illustrations bringing the story to life, A Likkle Miss Lou is a modern ode to language, girl power, diversity, and the arts. End matter includes a glossary of Jamaican patois terms, a note about the author's #OwnVoices perspective as a Jamaican-Canadian writer, and a brief biography of Miss Lou and her connection to Canada, where she lived for 20 years. \n",

        "description": "This bilingual Spanish-English edition is the first illustrated selection of questions, 60 in all, from Pablo Neruda's original poem (316 questions) The Book of Questions. Holding the wonder and mystery of childhood and the experience and knowing that come with growing up, these questions are by turns lyrical, strange, surreal, spiritual, historical and political. They foreground the natural world, and their curiosity transcends all logic; and because they are paradoxes and riddles that embrace the limits of our ability to know, they engage with human freedom in the deepest way, removing the burden and constraint that somehow, we are meant to have answers to every question. \n\nGorgeously, cosmically illustrated by Paloma Valdivia, here Neruda's questions, already visual in themselves, gain a double visuality that makes them even more palpable and resonant. So clearly rooted in Chilean landscapes as they are, the questions are revealed as a communion with nature and its mysteries. \n",

At first Corinne believes Mama D'Leau, the powerful and cruel jumbie who rules the ocean, has caused the hurricane. Then an even more ferocious storm wrecks the island, sending villagers fleeing their houses for shelter in the mountains, and Corinne discovers the storms weren't caused by a jumbie, but by the angry god Huracan. \n\nNow Corinne, with the help of her friends and even some of her enemies, must race against time to find out what has angered Huracan and try to fix it before her island home is destroyed forever. \n\nThe Jumbie God's Revenge blends Caribbean and West African tales to present powerful themes of community and heroism in a heart-pounding action adventure. \n",

        "description": "Stroll through any public park in Brooklyn on a weekday afternoon and you will see black women with white children at every turn. Many of these women are of Caribbean descent, and they have long been a crucial component of New York's economy, providing childcare for white middle- and upper-middleclass families. Raising Brooklyn offers an in-depth look at the daily lives of these childcare providers, examining the important roles they play in the families whose children they help to raise. Tamara Mose Brown spent three years immersed in these Brooklyn communities: in public parks, public libraries, and living as a fellow resident among their employers, and her intimate tour of the public spaces of gentrified Brooklyn deepens our understanding of how these women use their collective lives to combat the isolation felt during the workday as a domestic worker.\n\nThough at first glance these childcare providers appear isolated and exploited-and this is the case for many-Mose Brown shows that their daily interactions in the social spaces they create allow their collective lives and cultural identities to flourish. Raising Brooklyn demonstrates how these daily interactions form a continuous ex...show more",

Using wills, legal petitions, family correspondences, and inheritance lawsuits, Daniel Livesay is the first scholar to follow the hundreds of children born to white planters and Caribbean women of color who crossed the ocean for educational opportunities, professional apprenticeships, marriage prospects, or refuge from colonial prejudices.\n\nThe presence of these elite children of color in Britain pushed popular opinion in the British Atlantic world toward narrower conceptions of race and kinship. Members of Parliament, colonial assemblymen, merchant kings, and cultural arbiters - the very people who decided Britain' colonial policies, debated abolition, passed marital laws, and arbitrated inheritance disputes - rubbed shoulders with these mixed-race Caribbean migrants in parlors and sitting rooms.

Bastian wants to put an end to Don Flacco’s cruel practice, so when he discovers a treasure map showing hidden gold on his father’s sunken ship, he comes up with a plan to buy back the land.\n Bastian needs to find the gold first, so he takes a job on a vessel transporting cargo in the Caribbean in hopes of locating the downed craft. During a hurricane at sea, Bastian rescues an injured albatross, which he names Zwazo.\n The newfound and most friendly duo is soon stalked by an evil pirate named Mud Beard, after word gets out about Bastian’s quest for gold. Possessing a fortune-telling blue crystal, Mud Beard always knows Bastian’s next move. The young mariner encounters more danger while marooned on a desert island with blood-thirsty cannibals.\n A cryptic message from Tularon, a witch doctor, forces Bastian to face the mysterious sorcerer. According to rumor, Tularon turns his enemies into giant lizards and is protected by highly skilled female bodyguards.\n Tularon agrees to help Bastian if the boy retrieves a valuable treasure for the mysterious witch doctor.\n Will Bastian ever return to his island in time to rescue the farmers and save his big Crush, Elena?

        "description": "Join a young boy and his father on a daring journey from Mexico to Texas to find a new life. They'll need all the resilience and courage they can muster to safely cross the border - la frontera - and to make a home for themselves in a new land. AGES: 8 to 10 AUTHORS: Alfredo Alva is a stonemason from La Ceja, Mexico. He and his family live in Texas, where he designs architectural details from stone for local architects. He met Deborah Mills while working on a local architecture project, and they worked together to write his story and obtain photos of his family and hometown in Mexico. Deborah Mills is an architect who has lived and travelled all over the world with her family. She divides her time between Texas and the Thousand Islands. SELLING POINTS: Told from the point of view of an undocumented immigrant child about finding a new home, learning a new language and finding a place to belong. Spanish and English used equally throughout, extending the access to this important message across multiple languages, cultures and reading levels. Themes of resilience and perseverance, familial separation, social anxiety and acceptance abound. Help unpack the definition and history of immigration as well as show photographs of locations and people depicted in Alfredo's story. \n",

This great political and literary figure of the nineteenth century has been one of the most influential men in all the Americas. A spiritual autobiography, SIMPLE VERSES captures in each poem an experience, a feeling or a moment that formed the poet and the man. The poet, the soldier, the troubadour, the legislator, the searcher for truth, the enraptured and the disenchanted lover, the defender of poetry and its transformer, the genius and the man - all alternate in a modulated and musical flow like life itself, which it embodies.

Asia, Africa, Europe--Antonio Chuffat's ancestors clashed and blended on the beautiful island of Cuba. Yet for most Cubans in the nineteenth century, life is anything but beautiful. The country is fighting for freedom from Spain. Enslaved Africans and near-enslaved Chinese indentured servants are forced to work long, backbreaking hours in the fields. So Antonio feels lucky to have found a good job as a messenger, where his richly blended cultural background is an asset. Through his work he meets Wing, a young Chinese fruit seller who barely escaped the anti-Asian riots in San Francisco, and his sister Fan, a talented singer. With injustice all around them, the three friends are determined to prove that violence is not the only way to gain liberty. \n",

        "description": "Important notice about language credentials: It is advised that before purchasing a language book that you read the author's biography to know if they have the proper credentials of a language scholar. For example, what is their title? Is it Mr. or Doctor? Additionally, do they have a graduate degree and education as a linguist, including experience as a language professor at an accredited University. These are important aspects to consider before throwing your money away on a language book written by a layman, especially those claiming to be Taino linguists with no educational background to support their claim. This book has not only been written by a language scholar but it is the first book written in the Taino language, an indigenous language of the Caribbean thought to be extinct since the 16th Century. The book is a seminal work cleverly assembled by Professor Richard Morrow Porrata Doria, Ph.D., a retired professor from the Multilingual and Cultural Institute Division at the University of Puerto Rico and a retired colonel who served as a language instructor for the United States Army. Dr. Morrow, a Taino descendant, also received 120 hours of Native American linguistics training from the Northwest Indian Language Institute at the University of Oregon towards revitalizing Native American languages that have been dormant or thought to be extinct. Therefore, this book has been professionally developed to awaken the Taino language. Simple instruction is given in the first part of the book so that the reader can understand how the Taino language syntax formulates words and phrases. The main body of the book is the fairytale \"Chin-kori\" which is written in the Taino language and translated in English. Moreover, the fairytale has colorful illustrations that depicts animal characters with Chin-kori, a little boy guinea pig who is the main character, getting into mischief that he ultimately regrets. The theme of the fairytale is that one should listen to their parents, teachers, elders, and a divine authority and should take responsibility for their poor decisions or actions. The book is designed for both children and adults to learn and enjoy the Taino language along with attention to its beautiful rhythmic flow. An excellent school book for Puerto Rican culture, history, and language.",

Her books have garnered starred reviews, the Américas Award, two Pura Belpré Author Honors, and the prestigious Rockefeller Fellowship on Chicano Cultural Literacy.

Additional information about each tribe is included in the \"About the Storytellers\" section. \n\nOnce again Jane Louise Curry has skillfully retold traditional tales of Native Americans.

In this collection of ten retold Jamaican stories, Anansi the spider tricks, sings, and dances his way into and out of trouble. But who is Anansi? It was the Ashanti of West Africa who brought the spider into the Caribbean. He clung tight to the web he wove in the minds of those who had been captured, surviving not only the harrowing passage across the Atlantic Ocean, but hundreds of years of slavery. As a trickster, Anansi has both good and bad traits, which makes him very human. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses. When he wins he dances and sings for joy. When he loses, he shakes it off and keeps on living, a lesson for us all.",

Lately, though, things have become a little less perfect. Mami has a new hairdo and a new amigo named Luis with whom she has been spending a LOT of time.

When Mami announces that she and Luis are getting married and that they will all be moving to a new casa, Juana is quite distraught. Lucky for her, though, some things will never change -- like how much Mami loves her.

        "description": "Over several generations villagers of Dominica have been shifting from Patwa, an Afro-French creole, to English, the official language. Despite government efforts at Patwa revitalization and cultural heritage tourism, rural caregivers and teachers prohibit children from speaking Patwa in their presence. Drawing on detailed ethnographic fieldwork and analysis of video-recorded social interaction in naturalistic home, school, village and urban settings, the study explores this paradox and examines the role of children and their social worlds. It offers much-needed insights into the study of language socialization, language shift and Caribbean children's agency and social lives, contributing to the burgeoning interdisciplinary study of children's cultures. Further, it demonstrates the critical role played by children in the transmission and transformation of linguistic practices, which ultimately may determine the fate of a language. \n",

        "description": "What happens when mothers are forced to emigrate in search of economic opportunities to provide a better life for their children? What happens to the child? Feelings of abandonment... longing... anger... Barrel Child by Pamela K. Marshall is a fictional account of the struggles a family must overcome when circumstance forces proof of a mother's love to be sent via airmail, and the ripple effects of material things taking the place of a mother's presence. While the term \"barrel child\" is not widely known, the phenomenon's devastating effects on children and familial ties have long plagued Jamaica. With economic prospects declining in the country and almost half of Jamaican households headed by women, many mothers are forced to emigrate to the United States, Canada or Europe in search of employment and better economic opportunities to support their children. Sadly, these mothers must leave their children behind with close friends or relatives until they can amass the financial means to have their children join them overseas. Often, mothers are separated from their children for years, only able to send barrels of food, clothes, money and other sustenance to show their love. Such is the fate of Sara Lewis, a young woman left under her aunt and uncle's care while her mother ventures to America to set up a better life for them. The novel tells Sa...show more",

When his mysterious employer, Eli Glinn, gives him an eyebrow-raising mission, he has no reason to refuse. Gideon's task: steal a page from the priceless Book of Kells, now on display in New York City and protected by unbreakable security. Accomplishing the impossible, Gideon steals the parchment--only to learn that hidden beneath the gorgeously illuminated image is a treasure map dating back to the time of the ancient Greeks. As they ponder the strange map, they realize that the treasure it leads to is no ordinary fortune. It is something far more precious: an amazing discovery that could perhaps even save Gideon's life.

        "description": "Suffering heavy damage in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017, Puerto Rican communities lacked access to clean water and electricity. Salvador Gomez-Colon couldn't ignore the basic needs of his homeland, and knew that nongovernmental organizations and larger foreign philanthropies could only do so much. With unstoppable energy and a deep knowledge of local culture, Salvador founded Light and Hope for Puerto Rico and raised more than $100,000 to purchase and distribute solar-powered lamps and hand-powered washing machines to households in need. \n\nWith a voice that is both accessible and engaging, Salvador recalls living through the catastrophic storm and grappling with the destruction it left behind. Hurricane brings forward a captivating first-person account of strength, resilience, and determination, and heralds the start of a new series of compelling narrative nonfiction by young people, for young people. \n",

The Forest in the Clouds explores the enchanting world of the Monte Verde cloud forest in Costa Rica. Discover the splendor and fragile beauty of a precarious ecosystem that receives up to 10 feet of rain and mist each year.

Chapter authors use the term Dis/ability to criticize aspects of education research and international development that do not center the experiences of dis/abled students and people with dis/abilities. Through case studies from around the Americas, chapters highlight how top-down approaches to disabilities further oppress rather than emancipate. The volume prioritizes the spaces of resistance where local initiatives speak back to the demands imposed by an ever-globalizing world shaped by colonialism and imperialism, undergird by intersectional ableism. Voices of disabled students and people with dis/abilities counter-narrate the personal, interpersonal, structural, and political ways in which biomedical and psychological models of disability have impacted their well-being throughout education and society in the Americas. Through a critical sentipensante approach that centers the \"epistemologies of the south,\" this volume challenges global mental health and dis/ability hegemony in the Americas. \n",

Galeano also highlights individuals such as Pedro Fernandes Sardinha, the first bishop of Brazil, who was eaten by Caete Indians off the coast of Alagoas, as well as Abdul Kassem Ismael, the grand vizier of Persia, who kept books safe from war by creating a walking library of 117,000 tomes aboard four hundred camels, forming a mile-long carava...show more",

We asked ourselves, \"What would happen if two young boys found themselves abandoned aboard the Lord Sheffield in the middle of the Caribbean Sea? What would they do? Could they figure out how to save the ship and safely get her to port? And how much of their parent's lessons do children really absorb?\" Set aboard the tall ship Lord Sheffield and on several Caribbean islands and countries, including Saba, Carriacou, Guyana and St Maarten, we follow Brian, the \"Barracuda Kid,\" as he fights to save the Lord Sheffield and then set's off on a desperate voyage to rescue his dad and Captain Olsten from ruthless, modern day pirates. Along the way, Brian and his companions experience the beauty of the islands, the richness of Caribbean culture and the challenges of navigating an old, but beautiful ship, across wide swaths of the Caribbean Sea. The story explores the relationships between mothers and sons, older people and children, and friends who become as close as family.

It is also the story of brothers and sisters torn apart by politics and how a Cuban teenager and his family end up by sheer accident - on the other side of the world. \n\nWarm, generous and gently amusing, Child of the Revolution stirs the heart and brings music to the soul. \n",

Three hundred thousand of them are impoverished children in Haiti, who \"stay with\" families as unpaid and uneducated domestic workers, subject to physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. This practice, known locally as restavek (\"staying with\"), is so widespread that one in ten Haitian children is caught up in this form of slavery.\n\n\nJean-Robert Cadet was a restavek in Haiti from the late 1950s until the early 1970s. He told the harrowing story of his youth in Restavec: From Haitian Slave Child to Middle-Class American-a landmark book that exposed ongoing child slavery in Haiti. Now in My Stone of Hope, Cadet continues his story from his early attempts to adjust to freedom in American society to his current life mission of eliminating child slavery through advocacy and education. As he recounts his own struggles to surmount the psychological wounds of slavery, Cadet puts a human face on the suffering that hundreds of thousands of Haitians still endure daily.

I also love the sense of humor, the clever plotting, and the fantastic cast of characters. But most of all I love Pahua: her courage, her kindness, and her love for family.--NYT best-selling author Rick Riordan Pahua Moua has a bit of a reputation for being a weirdo. A lonely eleven-year-old Hmong girl with the unique ability to see spirits, she spends her summer days babysitting her little brother and playing with her best friend, a cat spirit no one else can see. One day Pahua accidentally untethers an angry spirit from the haunted bridge in her neighborhood--whoops. When her brother suddenly falls sick and can't be awoken, Pahua fears that the bridge spirit has stolen his soul. She returns to the scene of the crime with her aunt's old shaman tools, hoping to confront the spirit and demand her brother's return. Instead, she summons a demon. Thankfully, a warrior shaman with a bit of an attitude problem shows up at the last minute and saves her butt. With the help of this guide, Pahua w...show more",

The new regime regarded the Amerasians as children of the enemy and ostracised them from Vietnamese society. The U.S. government passed the Homecoming Act of 1988, finally facilitating immigration of Amerasians to the United States. Now young adults, most who have emigrated have faced difficulty adjusting to a new culture and only about 2 percent have been reunited with their fathers. Revealing and often poignant, the 38 interviews here give voice to the struggle that Amerasians and their mothers faced in their homeland. \n",

Unfortunately, they were not among the few thousand Amerasian children who came to the United States before the war's end and grew up as Americans, speaking English and attending American schools. Instead, this group of Amerasians faced much more formidable obstacles, both in Vietnam and in their new home. \n\nSurviving Twice raises significant questions about how mixed-race children born of wars and occupations are treated and the ways in which the shifting laws, policies, social attitudes, and bureaucratic red tape of two nations affect them their entire lives. \n",

        "description": "Covering a period of 115 years, 1850-1965, Children of the Monkey God deals with the experiences of four generations of a Chinese family in Sarawak, Borneo. Candid and at times humorous, satirical and controversial, it vividly captures life at the crossroads of changes in the 1950's and '60's when the sun was setting on the colonial era. It conveys to the reader the multi-layered cultural influences of British colonialism, the burgeoning American pop-scene, the various Chinese dialect groups as well as that of the local indigenous people. It also offers a fascinating insight into some of the social, cultural and religious beliefs and practices of a world that is fast disappearing and seldom seen by outsiders.The author, FS Choo grew up in a traditional Chinese Hakka family in Sarawak, Malaysia at a time when it was administered by the British. Written in the gentle style of his native culture, he charts and reveals a fascinating world beginning with his great grandfather's migration from China to West Kalimantan, also known as Borneo in the early 1850's; his life as a gold-miner there and his connection to the mysterious 'Kongsi', a unique self-governing grass-root democratic organization that flourished until the mid 1800's when it came into conflict with the Dutch colonial rulers and the White Rajahs of Sarawak, Borneo. Above all else, the book offers a series of alternative view on controversial historical events. On the significance, culturally, socially and economically of the organizations known as the 'Kongsi', organizations that the Dutch and British colonialists brushed aside as no more significant than mere 'social clubs' where the miners met to smoke opium. The book, in contrast, would take you into a insightful look into the real nature of these so-called 'social clubs,' where grass-root democracy was in full practice with the members, as shareholders, having the right to vote as to who their leaders should be. And this in the 1800's, where the course of history in South-east and East Asia would have been different had the 'Kongsi\" (translated as 'Company' in Chinese) were not destroyed by the Dutch colonialists in West Borneo in a series of punitive military campaigns and the British colonialists in Sarawak in the squashing of the 'Bau Rebellion (1857)'. They would, in all probabilities, be the harbinger of a new democratic era in that part of the world.",

The Americans left behind a $8 billion facility and because of the volunteers not a single thing was stolen. The forest in Subic Bay and its rich flora and fauna were safeguarded. All this and much more were achieved through the efforts of those who willingly served without pay. The Children of the Sun arose as one to meet the herculean trials presented to them, united by a common purpose and by common values-duty, honor, courage, and, above all, love of family and country.This is their story. \n",

Engineers building a railroad discover that the gravel they're using is actually 5,000-year-old crumbling brick from the ancient Indus Valley civilization. An Englishman living in India is fascinated by the mysterious script on the ancient coins he collects and works feverishly to decode the long-lost language. These are a few of the clues to a fascinating history\nthat you'll read about in The Ancient South Asian World. Jonathan Mark Kenoyer and Kimberley Heuston use ancient beads, terracotta pots, trash found in a sewer, and many other\nprimary sources to trace the history of this diverse region. In these pages is the story of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, who used the power of knowledge rather than physical force to rule his people-an unusual idea at the time. Ancient texts and an epic poem called the Ramayana explain the practices and beliefs of Brahmanism and how they evolved into Hinduism. Columns inscribed by Emperor Ashoka illustrate the spread of Buddhism throughout the South Asian world. The sacred epic called the\nMahabharata helps explain the development of the caste system.

Clearly, these children have undergone some process of socialization, but what?\n\nOver ten years ago, anthropologist Bambi Chapin travelled to a rural Sri Lankan village to begin answering this question, getting to know the toddlers in the village, then returning to track their development over the course of the following decade. Childhood in a Sri Lankan Village offers an intimate look at how these children, raised on the tenets of Buddhism, are trained to set aside selfish desires for the good of their families and the community. Chapin reveals how this cultural conditioning is carried out through small everyday practices, including eating and sleeping arrangements, yet she also explores how the village's attitudes and customs continue to evolve with each new generation.show more",

        "description": "The 19th-century Bengali mystic Ramakrishna played a major role in the development of Hinduism and is regarded as a modern saint. Yet he remains an enigma to followers unable to reconcile his saintly status with his eroticized language and actions. In this work, Jeffrey J. Kripal attempts to untangle the paradox. He demonstrates that Ramakrishna's famous mystical experiences were driven by erotic energies that he neither fully accepted nor understood; the key to understanding him, Kripal argues, lies in Tantra and its ritual, symbolic and doctrinal equation of the mystical and the erotic. Moving through Ramakrishna's world both chronologically and conceptually, this book employs two complementary interpretive strategies: a nuanced phenomenological reinterpretation of original Bengali texts and a non-reductive psychoanalytic reading of Ramakrishna's mystical eroticism. Kripal shows how the heterosexual structure of Tantric symbolism, the abusive way its rituals were often forced upon the saint, and Ramakrishna's own homosexual desires all came together to produce in him profound feelings of shame, disgust and fear.\nKripal establishes that the homosexuality of this great, if unwilling, Tantric mystic is linked inextricably t...show more",

Walter Cronkite was the voice of the conflict, and grim, nightly statistics the most recognizable feature. But as involvement grew, Vietnam affected numerous changes in child life, comparable to the childhood impact of previous conflicts-chiefly the Civil War and World War II-whose intensity and duration also dominated American culture. In this protracted struggle that took on the look of permanence from a child's perspective, adult lives were increasingly militarized, leaving few preadolescents totally insulated. Over the years 1965 to 1973, the vast majority of American children integrated at least some elements of the war into their own routines. Parents, in turn, shaped their children's perspectives on Vietnam, while the more politicized mothers and fathers exposed them to the bitter polarization the war engendered. The fighting only became truly real insomuch as service in Vietnam called away older community members or was driven home literally when families shared hardships surrounding separation from cousins, brothers, and fathers.In seeing the Vietnam War through the eyes of preadolescent Ameri...show more",

But when her life in the fast lane falls apart - again - it's time for a miracle. Reeling from the worst week of her life, topped off by her most important client stabbing her in the back, Fran realises that she's almost forgotten what her family looks like. She wants out of the rat race and her hectic life as a literary agent- and time to be herself, a real wife and mother to her two small children. Good old Frank delivers what seems the answer to her prayers- to escape for three months to Singapore while he does some business. But what starts out as a little break and a very big culture shock for all concerned marks the hilarious beginning of the end of the old Fran- and a whole new life. \n",

The authors explore parents' motivations for sending their children to distant schools and monasteries, social connections that shape migration pathways, young people's estrangement from village life, and dilemmas that arise when educated individuals are unable or unwilling to return and reside in their native villages. Drawing on numerous decades of research, this study documents a transitional period when the future of a Himalayan society teeters on the brink of irreversible change. \n",

It would take a young warrior to survive it.\n\nCinelle Barnes was barely three years old when her family moved into Mansion Royale, a stately ten-bedroom home in the Philippines. Filled with her mother's opulent social aspirations and the gloriously excessive evidence of her father's self-made success, it was a girl's storybook playland. But when a monsoon hits, her father leaves, and her mother's terrible lover takes the reins, Cinelle's fantastical childhood turns toward tyranny she could never have imagined. Formerly a home worthy of magazines and lavish parties, Mansion Royale becomes a dangerous shell of the splendid palace it had once been.\n\nIn this remarkable ode to survival, Cinelle creates something magical out of her truth--underscored by h...show more",

Its members were inspired by religious fanatics and came from many faiths, yet they worshiped one goddess, Kali. In her name, they murdered more than one million Indian travelersall without spilling a drop of blood. Their weapon was the handkerchief, their sacrament sugar, and the gang was supposedly eradicated by the British in the 1830s. \n\nToday, a modern-day bandit named Veerappan is India's most-wanted man and most notorious criminal, responsible for more than one hundred murders. Some say he is a freedom fighter, others that he is a vicious killer. Still at large in the jungles of southwestern India, he avoids capture, his followers claim, by magical powers.\n\nIn Children of Kali, Kevin Rushby researches these two criminal legends, both of which have been distorted and misused by those in power. As intrepid an investigator as he is an elegant writer, Rushby recounts his quest both to gain a meeting with Veerappan and to untangle the legends of the Thug Cult and the British policeman...show more",

What Kevin Kwan did for rich-people problems, Diksha Basu does for trying-to-be-rich-people problems.\"--People NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY ESQUIRE - A PEOPLE PICK - A TIME PICK The Jhas are moving up. For the past thirty years, their lives have been defined by cramped spaces and gossipy neighbors. But when Mr. Jha comes into an enormous sum of money--the result of an unexpectedly successful internet venture--he moves his reluctant wife from their housing complex in East Delhi to the super-rich side of town, ultimately forcing them, and their son, to reckon with who they are and what really matters to them. Hilarious and wise, The Windfall illuminates with warmth and heart the precariousness of social status, the fragility of pride, and, above all, the human drive to build and share a home. Even the rich, it turns out, need to belong somewhere. Praise for The Windfall \"A delightful comedy of errors.\"--NPR, Weekend Edition\n\n\"Ultra-charming.\"--Vogue \"I almost fell out of bed laughing.\"--Kevin Kwan, author of Crazy Rich Asians \"A fun and heartfelt comedy of manners.\"--Rolling Stoneshow more",

His neighborhood is empty--except for the many cats left behind. Alaa loves Aleppo, but when war comes his neighbors flee to safety, leaving their many pets behind. Alaa decides to stay--he can make a difference by driving an ambulance, carrying the sick and wounded to safety. One day he hears hungry cats calling out to him on his way home.

The book was originally published here in 1972 and was hailed by James Beard as \"a landmark in the field of cookery\"; this new version represents the accumulation of the author's thirty years of further extensive travel throughout the ever-changing landscape of the Middle East, gathering recipes and stories. Now Ms. Roden gives us more than 800 recipes, including the aromatic variations that accent a dish and define the country of origin: fried garlic and cumin and coriander from Egypt, cinnamon and allspice from Turkey, sumac and tamarind from Syria and Lebanon, pomegranate syrup from Iran, preserved lemon and harissa from North Africa. She has worked out simpler approaches to traditional dishes, using healthier ingredients and time-saving methods without ever sacrificing any of the extraordinary flavor, freshness, and texture that distinguish the cooking of this part of the world.

The idea that any group of people would willingly sacrifice their own children to their god(s) is so contrary to modern moral sensibilities that it is difficult to imagine that such a practice could have ever existed. Nonetheless, the existence of biblical condemnation of these rites attests to the fact that some ancient Israelites in fact did sacrifice their children. Indeed, a close reading of the evidence-biblical, archaeological, epigraphic, etc.-indicates that there are at least three different types of Israelite child sacrifice, each with its own history, purpose, and function.\n\n\n\nIn addition to examining the historical reality of Israelite child sacrifice, Dewrell's study also explores the biblical rhetoric condemning the practice. While nearly every tradition preserved in the Hebrew Bible rejects child sacrifice as abominable to Yahweh, the rhetorical strategies employed by the biblical writers vary to a surprising de...show more",

The reader of these Arabic Folktales will observe many points of similarity between them and the popular fictions of the West- similarity of thought and incident- and nothing, perhaps, speaks more eloquently the universal brotherhood of man than this oneness of folk-fiction.

While there was an initial global outcry and a movement led by Woodrow Wilson to aid the \"starving Armenians,\" the promises to hold the perpetrators accountable were never fulfilled. In this groundbreaking work, Michael Bobelian profiles the leading players-Armenian activists and assassins, Turkish diplomats, U.S. officials- each of whom played a significant role in furthering or opposing the century-long Armenian quest for justice in the face of Turkish denial of its crimes, and reveals the events that have conspired to eradicate the \"forgotten Genocide\" from the world's memory. \n",

There they suffered deprivation in Siberian gulags and \"Special Settlements\" and then, once \"liberated\", journeyed to the Soviet Central Asian Republics. The majority lived out the war in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan; some of them continued to Iran. The story of their suffering has rarely been told. \n\nFollowing in the footsteps of her father, one of a thousand refugee children who travelled to Iran and later to Palestine, Dekel fuses memoir with historical investigation in this account of the all-but-unknown Jewish refuge in Muslim lands. Along the way, Dekel reveals the complex global politics behind this journey, discusses refugee aid and hospitality, and traces the making of collective identities that have shaped the post-war world-the histories nations tell and those they forget. \n",

In 1979, seemingly overnight--moving at a clip some thirty years faster than the rest of the world--Iran became the first revolutionary theocracy in modern times. Since then, the country has been largely a black box to the West, a sinister presence looming over the horizon. But inside Iran, a breathtaking drama has unfolded since then, as religious thinkers, political operatives, poets, journalists, and activists have imagined and reimagined what Iran should be. They have drawn as deeply on the traditions of the West as of the East and have acted upon their beliefs with urgency and passion, frequently staking their lives for them. With more than a decade of experience reporting on, researching, and writing about Iran, Laura Secor narrates this unprecedented history as a story of individuals caught up in the slipstream of their time, seizing and wielding ideas powerful enough to shift its course as they wrestle with their country's apparatus of violent repression as well as its rich and often tragic history.

Riad, delicate and wide-eyed, follows in the trail of his mismatched parents; his mother, a bookish French student, is as modest as his father is flamboyant. Venturing first to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab State and then joining the family tribe in Horns, Syria, they hold fast to the vision of the paradise that always lies just around the corner. And hold they do, though food is scarce, children kill dogs for sport, and with locks banned, the Sattoufs come home one day to discover another family occupying their apartment. The ultimate outsider, Riad, with his flowing blond hair, is called the ultimate insult...Jewish. And in no time at all, his father has come up with yet another grand plan, moving from building a new people to building his own great palace. \n",

She watches from her bed as her grandmother prepares to pray. During her stay, Yasmin's grandmother makes her prayer clothes, buys her a prayer rug, and teaches her the five prayers that Muslims perform over the course of a day. When it's time for Yasmin to board a plane and return home, her grandmother gives her a present. When Yasmin opens the present when she gets home, she discovers a prayer clock in the shape of a mosque, with an alarm that sounds like a muezzin calling the faithful to prayer.\n\nMaha Addasi's warm and endearing story, richly illustrated by Ned Gannon, is the recipient of an Arab American Book Award, Honor Book.

        "description": "This volume continues the stories of the Israelite patriarchs and prophets who figured in Volume II, as well as of the semi-mythical rulers of ancient Iran. In addition to biblical, Qur'anic, and legendary accounts about Moses, Aaron, and the exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt; of the Judges, Samuel and Ezekiel; and of Saul, David, and Solomon, it includes a version of Iranian prehistory that emphasizes the role of Manuchihr (Manushihr in Arabic) in creating the Iranian nation and state. Woven into these accounts are stories about figures belonging to the very earliest literatures of the Middle East: the mysterious al-Khidwith echoes from the epic of the Sumero-Akkadian hero Gilgamesh; the legendary exploits of Dhu l-Qarnayn, mirroring the ancient romance of Alexander; and incorporating elements about the encounter of King Solomon and Bilqis, the Queen of Sheba, of Jewish midrash and South Arabian lore. The Islamic empire was at its political and economic height during the tenth and eleventh centuries, and a new civilization was forged at the caliphal court and in society at large. One of the literary triumphs of that civilization was this rich and colorful tapestry belonging to the Islamic genre of \"tales of the prophets.\" The tales in this volume show how threads from all the ancient civilizations of the Middle East were incorporated, absorbed, and Islamized...show more",

In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah's regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran's last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country. Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane's child's-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family.

Albanian dishes represent some of the tastiest in the region, and the recipes in this cookbook bring them to your home. The cuisine of Albania, like that of many Balkan and Mediterranean countries, is much influenced by the country's history. The area known now as Albania has been occupied or claimed through the years by Ottoman Turks, Italy, Serbia and Greece, and all these groups left their marks on Albanian cuisine. Albanians care a great deal about their midday meal, which is the main meal of the day. It usually features a fresh vegetable salad, along with the main dish of meat and vegetables. In the coastal areas of Albania, seafood specialties are quite common. In the areas that are higher in elevation, many people eat pickled preserves and smoked meats, since many of the other foods are not easily found in those regions. Albanian desserts are popular in many Balkan countries, and also trace their roots to Greece and Turkey. They incorporate lemons and oranges among the favorite flavors. Turn the page and start making Albanian meals for yourself! \n",

In 2004, Jared Cohen embarked on the first of a series of incredible journeys to the Middle East in an effort to understand the spread of radical Islamist violence among Muslim youth. The result is Children of Jihad, a portrait of paradox that probes much deeper than any journalist or pundit ever could. Chosen as one of Kirkus Review's Best Books of 2007, Cohen's account begins in Lebanon, where he interviews Hezbollah members at, of all places, a McDonald's. In Iran, he defies government threats and sneaks into underground parties, where bootleg liquor, Western music, and the Internet are all easy to access. His risky itinerary also takes him to a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon, borderlands in Syria, the insurgency hotbed of Mosul, and other front-line locales. At each turn, he observes a culture at an uncanny crossroads. Gripping and daring, Children of Jihad shows us the future through the eyes of those who are shaping it. \n",

The Bach Family is on the train - leaving Nazi Germany at the very last moment - two weeks before the notorious \"Crystal Night\" ('Kristallnacht') - which marks the beginning of the first step in the Nazi extermination plan- the massive arrest of Jewish men in Germany. The train is heading towards Holland as a stopover on the family's way to the Land of Israel (then \"Palestine\"). Once reaching the border, they hear an SS officer shouting their name: \"Where is the Bach family? Get off the train now, with your luggage!\" All their belongings are scattered on the ground for the search. The train is about to leave...Finally the order comes: \"Okay, take your luggage and get out of here!\" \n\nGabriel Bach - a skinny eleven-year-old boy, finds himself standing on the platform with a heavy suitcase...show more",

Dua is a believer's most powerful weapon, and remembering Allah often is an act that draws one closer to his Creator; through praising Him, reflecting on His attributes, and seeking His forgiveness. As parents, our goal should be to raise children who think and converse with Allah often, so they can grow up with a healthy Islamic mindset. \nMy First Duas from The Holy Quran will inshAllah take your child's relationship with Allah to another level. This book will teach your child some of the Holy Quran's most popular duas in Arabic and English, along with a description and explanation of the dua, helping your child understand what the dua means and when they should recite it in their lives. This book aims to make it easier for your child to memorize the duas and apply them in their daily lives, just like the past Messengers and Prophets of God did to seek guidance and assistance from Allah, the Glorious. Equip your child with a Muslim's most powerful weapon, dua to Allah, the Most-Generous, so they can start to talk to Allah and build a relationship with him. This can begin by learning and memorizing Dua, so it can be ingrained in their heart and mind. \n",

Yet childhood in any family is a mysterious experience. . . . What shapes the mind, the personality, the character?So begins this unexpected and extraordinary book by Ralph Nader. Known for his lifetime of selfless activism, Nader now looks back to the earliest days of his own life, to his serene and enriching childhood in bucolic Winsted, Connecticut. From listening to learning, from patriotism to argument, from work to simple enjoyment, Nader revisits seventeen key traditions he absorbed from his parents, his siblings, and the people in his community, and draws from them inspiring lessons for today's society. Warmly human, rich with sensory memories and lasting wisdom, it offers a kind of modern-day parable of how we grow from children into responsible adults--a reminder of a time when nature and community were central to the way we all learned and lived. \n",

Like the classic film The Battle of Algiers--enjoying renewed interest in the face of world events--Djebar's novel sheds light on current world conflicts as it reveals a determined Arab insurgency against foreign occupation, from the inside out. However, Djebar focuses on the experiences of women drawn into the politics of resistance. Her novel recounts the interlocking lives of women in a rural Algerian town who find themselves joined in solidarity and empower each other to engage in the fight for independence. Narrating the resistance movement from a variety of perspectives--from those of traditional wives to liberated students to political organizers--Djebar powerfully depicts the circumstances that drive oppressed communities to violence and at the same time movingly reveals the tragic costs of war. \n",

We can only guess when they separated from the common trunk of the Indo-European peoples, and when, maybe thousands of years later, they formed a separate large group, one of three - and together with the Romance and Germanic peoples they created the civilizational and geopolitical Europe in which we live today. Like others, they did not have their own name for a long time; as others were later named by their closest neighbors, and only after a few centuries by themselves. The book covers the period from the second century to the sixth century of the new era. At that time, Slavs appear on the pages of history as already formed, active and separate European people. This requires presentation and analysis of processes and events that take place at that time. It is a period that is still poorly known, but very controversial. \n",

        "description": "You and the Children in Beirut is a poetry book in Modern Standard Arabic. The book contains fifty-one poems. Most of the poems follow a specific meter and rhyme and are characterized by their penetrating musical effect in addition to their timely subject matter and the universal message that they convey. A master of prosody, George Nicolas El-Hage is famous for choosing short, musical meters that transport you into the realm of each poem and make you dance as you read his poems whether silently or in a loud voice. His poems have been described as \"interactive\" because they cause the reader to establish a dialogue with each poem due to their personalized message that enhances the reading experience. The last part of the book contains some prose poems that the author selected for inclusion in this volume. El-Hage's prose is as powerful, explosive and captivating as his poetry. The moving themes touch the reader's inner emotions and sensitivity. It is the cry of humanity, the passion for compassion, and the yearning for love in these poems that awaken in each of us a longing for universal brotherhood and unity. The revolt against war, the nostalgia for peace, and the compassion for children, the beloved and the homeland are the broader messages that reverberate throughout and permeate the poems that comprise this unique volume of M...show more",

These dishes sing with earthy spices, tomato, parsley, lemon and honeyed fruits, and a country index shows the origin of each recipe. Some of the well-loved favourites are: Hummus; Couscous; Pilaf; Tabbouleh; Lentil soup; Lamb stew.

Descended from a 1,000-year unbroken chain of rabbis, he grew up to become Chief Rabbi of Israel--and like many of the great rabbis, Lau is a master storyteller. Out of the Depths is his harrowing, miraculous, and inspiring account of life in one of the Nazis' deadliest concentration camps, and how he managed to survive against all possible odds. \nLau, who lost most of his family in the Holocaust, also chronicles his life after the war, including his emigration to Mandate Palestine during a period that coincides with the development of the State of Israel. The story continues up through today, with that once-lost boy of eight now a brilliant, charismatic, and world-revered figure who has visited with Popes John Paul and Benedict; the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, and countless global leaders including Ronald Reagan, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Tony Blair. \n",

Poland was not only home to Jabotinsky's largest following. The country also served as an inspiration and incubator for the development of right-wing Zionist ideas. Jabotinsky's Children draws on a wealth of rare archival material to uncover how the young people in Betar were instrumental in shaping right-wing Zionist attitudes about the roles that authoritarianism and military force could play in the quest to build and maintain a Jewish state.\n\nRecovering the voices of ordinary Betar members through their letters, diaries, and autobiographies, Jabotinsky's Children paints a vivid portrait of young Polish Jews and their turbulent lives on the eve of the Holocaust. Rather than define Jabotinsky as a firebrand fascist or steadfast democrat, the book instead reveals how he deliber...show more",

Here, thirty-six men and women, boys and girls, tell of their coming-of-age in a land of turmoil. \nFrom kibbutzim in Israel and the occupied territories to Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Israeli Jews and Palestinians tell of tragedy and transcendence as they face their deepest fears and dream of a peaceful future. Listen to them as they recount stories of their brief and often violent youth. \nNo matter what their ethnic identity, how much and how long they have suffered, these courageous autobiographers most often reveal a deep longing for peace. Perhaps their hopes and fears are best illustrated by a parable retold by eighteen-year-old Redrose (a pseudonym): \n\"Two frogs got trapped in a jar of cream. They couldn't jump out of the liquid and they couldn't climb because the sides of the jar were slippery. One frog said, 'By dawn I'll be dead,' and went to sleep. The second frog swam all night long and in the morning found herself floating on a pat of butter.\" \n",

It is designed to engage youngsters and adult coloring book enthusiasts in learning about the unique character of our nation's 22nd state. Every county in Alabama is featured in Amazing Alabama with an appealing line drawing of its iconic and lesser-known sites--historical, geographical, topographical, industrial and commercial, and more. Companion text identifies and provides context for the pictured elements. The book provides a comprehensive educational snapshot of all that is special about the state. Author/illustrator Laura Murray was inspired to create Amazing Alabama, her first coloring book, after moving to Alabama with her husband from Georgia. Together, they made many road trips, which introduced her to the state's history, its scenic highways and byways, its commercial centers and rustic small towns. Her coloring book showcases some of her favorite discoveries--the historic U.S. Post Office in Etowah County, Hatchet Creek in Coosa County, the pitcher plant bog in Chilton County, and much more. \n",

These beautiful motifs contain a perfectly synergised dichotomy of art and mathematics, ultimately, traversing the viewer to an understanding of the true nature of reality beneath the veil, thus, purifying mind and soul.

Hot on the heels of The New Middle Eastern Vegetarian, Sally Butcher brings us The New Middle Eastern Street Food Cookbook: a fabulous collection of quick, healthy, and easy-to-prepare recipes from Snackistan, a fictitious land where tummies are always full, and there's a slightly naughty smile on every face. It features simple fare that people actually eat on a daily basis: street food, or dishes they prepare at home, or cook to share with friends, or look forward to indulging in at the end of the week. Street food has come of age and, increasingly, formal dining is being nudged aside in favor of meze-style spreads. In malls and farmers markets across the world, food on the hoof has become a stylish and popular way to feed. This book picks out the Middle East's most exciting street foods and meze dishes, together with a variety of homely and simple snack recipes elicited from family and friends. Chapters comprise Nuts and Nibbles, Fishy Things, Meat on Sticks, Meat Not on Sticks, Salady Stuff, Hot Veggie Dishes, Mostly Carbs, Puds, and Something to Wash it Down with. The burst of flavors is intoxicating, as is Sally's trademark wit and attention to detail--a must-buy for all Middle Eastern food enthusiasts. - Over 100 recipes for mouthwatering Middle Eastern snacks - All asp...show more",

With candour and courage, she stitches together memories of her childhood: fear and confusion as bombs explode near her home; the harshness of life as a Palestinian refugee; her unexpected joy when she discovers Alef, the first letter of the Arabic alphabet. This is the beginning of her passionate connection to words, and as language becomes her refuge, allowing her to piece together the fragments of her world, it becomes her true home. Transcending the particulars of politics, this illuminating and timely book provides a telling glimpse into a little known culture that has become an increasingly important part of the puzzle of world peace. \n",

        "description": "Portrait of a Child is an illustrated guide to the fascinating story of the mummy known to archaeologists as \"Hawara Portrait Mummy No. 4.\" Discovered in 1910 by British archaeologist Flinders Petrie at the Roman-Egyptian archaeological site of Hawara, the mummified child had been buried with a luminous painted portrait which has captivated viewers ever since. This book tells the story of what cutting-edge research has revealed about her life and death. The centerpiece of a 2018 exhibit at Northwestern University's Block Museum of Art titled \"Paint the Eyes Softer: Mummy Portraits from Roman Egypt,\" the mummy was the focus on intense, multidisciplinary research. University researchers used CT scan technology to investigate the cause of the child's death and identify the method and materials used in mummification. Traveling to the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory, the mummy then became the first ever analyzed using Advanced Photon Source synchrotron technology, where a high-brilliance X-ray beam revealed more details about her bone matter and the materials she was entombed with. Accompanied by a wealth of color images, maps, and diagrams, Portrait of A Child, shares new scientific findings, as well as the conservation, ethical, and museological considerations weighed by the researchers and cura...show more",

After visiting the region to conduct interviews, she presents their stories here in their own words. Twelve-year-old Nora, eleven-year-old Mohammad, and many others speak directly about their lives which prove to be both ordinary and extraordinary: They argue with their siblings. They hate spinach. They have wishes for the future. Yet they have also seen their homes destroyed and families killed, and live amidst constant upheaval and violence. \n\nThis simple, telling book allows young readers everywhere to see that the children caught in this conflict are just like them but living far more difficult and dangerous lives. Without taking sides, it presents an unblinking portrait of children victimized by the endless struggle around them. \n",

        "description": "In a world where the making and consumption of art is constantly changing, the term \"Islamic art\" can be hard to define. Through the exploration of a wide array of media-from painting, sculpture, and photography to video and multimedia-an internationally renowned group of scholars, collectors, artists, and curators tackles questions such as whether the art has to come from the Middle East, whether it must have a religious component, and, indeed, whether the work of art must be made by a Muslim. Based on a series of papers presented at the 7th Biennial Hamad bin Khalifa Symposium on Islamic Art in 2017, the essays in this volume grapple with these questions from a range of viewpoints. These texts-including beautiful illustrations of major works by contemporary artists from the Muslim world, including Newsha Tavakolian, Shahzia Sikander, Hassan Hajjaj and Lalla Essaydi-invoke a lively discussion of how the arts of the Islamic lands link the past with the present and the future. \n",

        "description": "Since the days of Troy historic lands of Asia Minor have been home to Greeks. They are steeped in a rich fusion of Greek and Turkish culture and the histories of both are irrevocably entwined, fatefully connected. \"Children of Achilles\" tells the epic and ultimately tragic story of the Greek presence in Anatolia, beginning with the Trojan War and culminating in 1923 with the devastating population exchange that followed the Turkish War of Independence. The once magnificent, now ruined, cities that cluster along the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts of Turkey are reminders of a civilization that produced the first Hellenic enlightenment, giving birth to Homer, Herodotus and the first philosophers of nature.

Eleven-year-old Parvana lives with her family in one room of a bombed-out apartment building in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital city. Parvana's father -- a history teacher until his school was bombed and his health destroyed -- works from a blanket on the ground in the marketplace, reading letters for people who cannot read or write. One day, he is arrested for the crime of having a foreign education, and the family is left without someone who can earn money or even shop for food. As conditions for the family grow desperate, only one solution emerges. Forbidden to earn money as a girl, Parvana must transform herself into a boy, and become the breadwinner. The 15th anniversary edition includes a special foreword by Deborah Ellis as well as a new map, an updated author's note, and a glossary to provide young readers with background and context. All royalties from the sale of this book will go to Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan. Parvana's Fund supports education projects for Afghan women and children. \n",

Michael Stolowitzky, the only son of a wealthy Jewish family in Poland, was just three years old when war broke out and the family lost everything. His father, desperate to settle his business affairs, travels to France, leaving Michael in the care of his mother and Gertruda Bablinska, a Catholic nanny devoted to the family. When Michael's mother has a stroke, Gertruda promises the dying woman that she will make her way to Palestine and raise him as her own son. Written with the invaluable assistance of Michael, now seventy-two and living in New York City, GERTRUDA'S OATH re-creates Michael and Gertruda's amazing journey. Gripping vignettes bring to life the people who helped ensure their survival, including SS officer Karl Rink, who made it his mission to save Jews after his own Jewish wife was murdered; Rink's daughter, Helga, who escaped to a kibbutz, where she lived until her recent death; and the Jewish physician Dr. Berman, who aided Michael and Gertruda through the worst of times. GERTRUDA'S OATH is a story of extraordinary courage and moral strength in the face of horrific events. Like Schindler's List, it transcends history and religion to reveal the compassi...show more",

Wesley Adamczyk's gripping memoir, \"When God Looked the Other Way\", gives voice to the hundreds of thousands of victims of Soviet barbarism. Adamczyk was a young Polish boy when he was deported with his mother and siblings from their comfortable home in Luck to Soviet Siberia in May of 1940. His father, a Polish Army officer, was taken prisoner by the Red Army and eventually became one of the victims of the Katyn massacre. The family's separation and deportation marked the beginning of a ten-year odyssey in which Adamczyk endured nearly intolerable living conditions, meager food rations, and life-threatening epidemics, first in the Soviet Union and then in Iran, where his mother succumbed to exhaustion after mounting a harrowing escape from the Soviets. A memoir of a childhood spent in unspeakable circumstances, \"When God Looked the Other Way\" not only illuminates one of the darkest periods of European history but also traces the loss of innocence and the fight against despair that took root in one young boy.\nUnflinching and poignant, \"When God Looked the Other Way\" stands as a testament to the trials of a fa...show more",

Naji al-Ali grew up in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Hilweh in the south Lebanese city of Sidon, where his gift for drawing was discovered by the Palestinian poet Ghassan Kanafani in the late 1950s. Early the following decade he left for Kuwait, embarking on a thirty-year career that would see his cartoons published daily in newspapers from Cairo to Beirut, London to Paris. Resolutely independent and unaligned to any political party, Naji al-Ali strove to speak to and for the ordinary Arab people; the pointed satire of his stark, symbolic cartoons brought him widespread renown. Through his most celebrated creation, the witness-child Handala, al-Ali criticized the brutality of Israeli occupation, the venality and corruption of the regimes in the region, and the suffering of the Palestinian people, earning him many powerful enemies and the soubriquet 'the Palestinian Malcolm X'. \nFor the first time in book form, \"A Child in Palestine\" presents the work of one of the Arab world's greatest cartoonists, revered throughout the region for his outspokenness, honesty and humanity. \n",

First proclaimed by the Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century, Islam quickly spread, through trade and conquest, from the Arabian Peninsula to vast sections of Asia and Africa and even to parts of Europe. The cast of characters in this story is fascinating: from the Prophet himself to Abu\nBakr Muhammad ar-Razi, a Persian physician who compiled a multivolume medical encyclopedia; Mehmed II, an Ottomon sultan who conquered Constantinople and brought the Byzantine Empire to an end; Mansa\nMusa, a West African emperor who distributed gifts of gold all along the route to Mecca; and Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan Berber whose travels through the Islamic world in the 14th century covered 75,000 miles.The pages of The African and Middle Eastern World tell not only about these figures and many others but also about Islamic principles and laws, the religion's different branches (including the Sunnis and Shiites), and the widely varied geography and cultural\npractices of this world.

Ramzi Hussein Aburedwan, a child from a Palestinian refugee camp, confronts an occupying army, gets an education, masters an instrument, dreams of something much bigger than himself, and then, through his charisma and persistence, inspires others to work with him to make that dream real. The dream: a school to transform the lives of thousands of children--as Ramzi's life was transformed--through music. Musicians from all over the world came to help. A violist left the London Symphony Orchestra, in part to work with Ramzi at his new school. Daniel Barenboim, the eminent Israeli conductor, invited Ramzi to join his West Eastern Divan Orchestra, which he founded with the late Palestinian intellectual, Edward Said. Since then the two have played together frequently.\n\nChildren of the Stone chronicles Ramzi's journey--from stone thrower to music student to school founder--and shows how through his love of music he created something lasting and beautiful in a land torn by violence and war.

The New Arab Man challenges these stereotypes with the stories of ordinary Middle Eastern men as they struggle to overcome infertility and childlessness through assisted reproduction. Drawing on two decades of ethnographic research across the Middle East with hundreds of men from a variety of social and religious backgrounds, Marcia Inhorn shows how the new Arab man is self-consciously rethinking the patriarchal masculinity of his forefathers and unseating received wisdoms. This is especially true in childless Middle Eastern marriages where, contrary to popular belief, infertility is more common among men than women. Inhorn captures the marital, moral, and material commitments of couples undergoing assisted reproduction, revealing how new technologies are transforming their lives and religious sensibilities. And she looks at the changing manhood of husbands who undertake transnational \"egg quests\"--set against the backdrop of war and economic uncertainty--out of devotion to the infertile wives they love.\nTrenchant and emotionally gripping, The New Arab Man traces the emergence of new masculinities in t...show more",

In Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Newfoundland, the term Gallipoli alone is used to describe the 8 month campaign.\n\nIn early 1915 Russia was fighting a multi-front war against Germany, Austria/Hungary, and Turkey. While it had a sizeable army it struggled to deliver sufficient supplies to the troops. The landings at Gallipoli were an Allied attempt to clear a supply path through the Dardanelles to Russia. On April 25, 1915, after failed attempts to force a passage through the Dardanelles by naval forces alone, a force of British Empire and French troops landed at multiple places along the peninsula. The battles over the next eight months saw high casualties on both sides due to the exposed terrain, weather and closeness of the front lines. The invasion forces were successfully blocked by the Turkish troops and the subsequent Allied withdrawal meant the Russians would not be receiving supplies through the Dardanelles.\nshow more",

New York Times bestselling author Robert Jobson debunks the myths about the man who will be king, going beyond banal, bogus media caricatures of Charles to tell his true story. Jobson--who has spent nearly thirty years chronicling the House of Windsor, and has met Prince Charles on countless occasions--received unprecedented cooperation from Clarence House, the Prince's office, in writing this illuminating biography. King Charles divulges the full range of the Prince's profoundly held political beliefs: the United Kingdom's special relationship to the United States, climate change, Brexit, and immigration--to ultimately portray the kind of monarch Charles III will be. Jobson taps a number of sources close to the Prince who have never spoken on the record before, plus members of the Royal Household who have served the Prince during his decades of public life. This comprehensive profile also reveals the plans for Charles to serve as Prince Regent on...show more",

On a basic level, children are necessary for the perpetuation of a household. On a deeper level, the definitions of child and member of the household are far from categorical. This book begins to explore the multiple definitions of child and the way the child fits within a household. It examines what membership in the household looks like for children and what factors contribute to it. A study addressing what a child is and how a child's gender and social status affect her place in the household is vital to a proper understanding of the ancient Near Eastern household.\n\n\n\nDespite their importance, children have long been marginalized in discussions of ancient societies.

Barely two months later, the Iranian People's Fada'i Guerrillas officially announced their existence and began a long, drawn-out urban guerrilla war against the Shah's regime. \n\n\n\nIn Call to Arms, Ali Rahnema provides a comprehensive history of the Fada'is, beginning by asking why so many of Iran's best and brightest chose revolutionary Marxism in the face of absolutist rule. He traces how radicalised university students from different ideological backgrounds morphed into the Marxist Fada'is in 1971, and sheds light on their theory, practice and evolution. While the Fada'is failed to directly bring about the fall of the Shah, Rahnema shows they had a lasting impact on society and they ultimately saw their objective achieved. \n",

Walter Laqueur traces Zionism from its beginnings--with the emancipation of European Jewry from the ghettos in the wake of the French Revolution--to 1948, when the Zionist dream became a reality. He describes the contributions of such notable figures as Benjamin Disraeli, Moses Hess, Baron Edmond de Rothschild, and Sir Herbert Samuel, and he analyzes the seminal achievements of Theodor Herzl, Chaim Weitzmann, and David Ben Gurion. Laqueur outlines the differences between the various Zionist philosophies of the early twentieth century--socialist, Communist, revisionist, and cultural utopian--and he discusses both the religious and secular Jewish critics of the movement. He concluded with a dramatic account of the cataclysmic events of World War II, the clandestine immigration of Holocaust survivors, the tragic missed opportunities co-existence with both the Arab residents of Palestine and those in the surrounding countries, and the struggle to forge a new state on an ancient land. Laqueur's new preface analyzes the present-day difficulties, and places them into a fascinating and aluable historical context. \n",

Sources used include the Bible, Midrashim, other Rabbinical texts, and secular sources. Descendants of the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel in the Aggregate have certain national characteristics that allow us to confirm their Israelite ancestry. The pertinent criteria for determining Israelite origins are discussed. Jewish Traditions in Arab Lands traced the Ten Tribes to France and Britain. The same applies to the Sons of Moses and the Rechabites both of whom, in Jewish tradition, were also associated with the Ten Tribes and located in the same areas. Australia and New Zealand are the Land of Sinim which is one of the areas it was prophesied the Ten Tribes would be found in towards the End times (Isaiah 49:12). Rabbinical sources trace the Lost Ten Tribes to three major areas. We identify the areas in question and show how these identifications confirm the Lost Ten Tribes being now found among western peoples. A turning point in the history of England was marked by the Tudor Monarchs.

This memoir - a document of substantial historical value - tells of Sayyid Qutb's childhood in the village of Musha in Upper Egypt. The book documents the era between 1912 and 1918 - a decade of immensely important influence on the creation of modern Egypt. Written with much tenderness toward childhood memories, it has become a classic modern Arabic autobiography. The book offers a clear picture of Egyptian village life in the early twentieth century, its customs and lore, educational system, religious festivals, relations with the central government, and the struggle to modernize and retain its identity. Translators John Calvert and William Shepard have captured the beauty and intensity of Qutb's prose in their rendering of the work into English. Their masterly introduction situates the book in its cultural environment and Sayyid Qutb in his historical context. Although Qutb (1906-1966) is not a household name in the United States, he is well known throughout the Islamic World as the foundational thinker for a significant portion of the contemporary Muslim intelligentsia, including such non-Arab countries as Pakistan and Malaysia.

Incarcerated Childhood and the Politics of Unchilding deepens understanding of children as political capital in the hands of those in power, critically engaging children's voices alongside archival, historical, and ethnographic material in Palestine. Offering the concept of unchilding', Shalhoub-Kevorkian exposes the political work of violence designed to create, direct, govern, transform, and construct colonized children as dangerous, racialized others, enabling their eviction from the realm of childhood itself. Penetrating children's everyday intimate spaces and, simultaneously, their bodies and lives, unchilding works to enable a complex machinery of violence against Palestinian children: imprisonment, injuries, loss, trauma, and militarized political occupation. At the same time as the book documents violations of children's rights and the consequences this has for their present and future well-being, it charts children's resistance to and power to interrupt colonial violence, reclaiming childhood and, with it, Palestinian futures. \n",

        "description": "Using the methodology of modern scholars in the fields of Arabic lexicography, linguistics, and psychoanalysis, Tunisian feminist scholar Olfa Youssef investigates the rulings about inheritance, marriage, and homosexuality in the Qur'anic text itself and compares them with the interpretations provided by male Muslim theologians and legal scholars from medieval times to the present. In this book, she makes five central arguments: (1) There is a discrepancy between the layered signification in the Qur'anic text itself and the sutured explanations by religious scholars which have been enacted into law in many Muslim countries today; (2) the plurality of meanings is the quintessential essence of the Qur'an as evidenced in the absence of any sura over which there was unanimous agreement among Muslim scholars; (3) when male privilege was at stake, male legal scholars, to protect their own interests, ignored the divine text and based their rulings on human consensus; (4) Muslim medieval views on gender and homosexuality were more tolerant than contemporary ones; and finally (5), preferring indetermination and perplexity over the finality and certainties found in the judgements of male theologians, Youssef argues that only God knows the Qur'an's true meaning.

Now known for her bold spirit and probing mind, El Saadawi in this novel uncovers through a child's eyes the hypocritical values and traditions carried on by family, education, religion, and society. With amazing courage she weaves a tale of the fear, guilt, and repressive compliance forced upon her as a woman and upon her generation as the price to be paid for leading a civilized existence. Struggling to come to terms with taboos concerning her maturing body, the young Nawal's writing reveals the makings of a revolutionary spirit and relentlessly analytical mind.

The studies focus on the ideas, practices, and visual representations surrounding pregnancy and birth-giving from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance and offer the reader the possibility of observing the perception, representation, and theoretic paradigm of these events in a wide range of cultural contexts. The collection fits within multiple traditions of specialized scholarship, yet its scope suggests a geographically global approach and a new, multicultural methodology that encompasses a wide range of practices, historical periods, and topics. On one hand, it participates in the well-established medical, historical, and iconographic discourse on childbirth and family that has enticed much interest over the last two decades; on the other, its unique thematic structure includes cultures and periods previously ignored in similar collections of essays. The articles span from Northern Europe to the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and India, and connect the experience of childbirth to the exchanges of knowledge, religious beliefs, and social practices.

        "description": "Described by historians as a \"\"total war,\"\" World War I was the first conflict that required a comprehensive mobilization of all members of society, regardless of profession, age, or gender. Just as women became heads of households and joined the workforce in unprecedented numbers, children also became actively engaged in the war effort. Adding a new dimension to the historiography of World War I, Maksudyan explores the variegated experiences and involvement of Ottoman children and youth in the war. Rather than simply passive victims, children became essential participants as soldiers, wage earners, farmers, and artisans. They also contributed to the propaganda and mobilization effort as symbolic heroes and orphans of martyrs. Rebelling against their orphanage directors or trade masters, marching and singing proudly with their scouting companies, making long-distance journeys to receive vocational training or simply to find their families, they acquired new identities and discovered new forms of agency. Maksudyan focuses on four different groups of children: thousands of orphans in state orphanages (Daruleytam), apprentice boys who were sent to Germany, children and youth in urban centers who reproduced rivaling nationalist ideologies, and Armenian children who survived the genocide. With each group, the author sheds light on how the war dramaticall...show more",

The men and women of a modern Cairo neighborood unwittingly reenact the lives of their holy ancestors: from the feudal lord who disowns one son for diabolical pride and puts another to the test, to the savior of a succeeding generation who frees his people from bondage. This powerful novel confirms again the richness and variety of Mahfouz's storytelling and his status as the single most important writer in modern Arabic literature (Newsweek). \n",

Not only have millions of children been forced to witness war and its atrocities, but many are drawn into conflict as active participants. Nowhere has this been more evident than in Sierra Leone during its 11-year civil war. Drawing upon in-depth interviews and focus groups with former child soldiers of Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front, Myriam Denov compassionately examines how child soldiers are initiated into the complex world of violence and armed conflict. She also explores the ways in which the children leave this world of violence and the challenges they face when trying to renegotiate their lives and self-concepts in the aftermath of war.

Now, more than 125 years later, that treasure is kept in the Websters' attic with other scraps of time, ready to be discovered by another generation eager to know its family history. The second novel in Patricia C.

In this moving story that celebrates cultural diversity, a shy girl brings her West African grandmother--whose face bears traditional tribal markings--to meet her classmates. This is a perfect read for back to school--no matter what that looks like! It is Grandparents Day at Zura's elementary school, and the students are excited to introduce their grandparents and share what makes them special. Aleja's grandfather is a fisherman. Bisou's grandmother is a dentist. But Zura's Nana, who is her favorite person in the world, looks a little different from other grandmas. Nana Akua was raised in Ghana, and, following an old West African tradition, has tribal markings on her face. Worried that her classmates will be scared of Nana--or worse, make fun of her--Zura is hesitant to bring her to school. Nana Akua knows what to do, though. With a quilt of traditional African symbols and a bit of face paint, Nana Akua is able to explain what makes her special, and to make all of Zura's classmates feel special, too. \n",

In this stirring memoir, Sirleaf shares the inside story of her rise to power, including her early childhood; her experiences with abuse, imprisonment, and exile; and her fight for democracy and social justice. This compelling tale of survival reveals Sirleaf's determination to succeed in multiple worlds: from her studies in the United States to her work as an international bank executive to her election campaigning in some of Liberia's most desperate and war-torn villages and neighborhoods. It is also the story of an outspoken political and social reformer who, despite danger, fought the oppression of dictators and championed change. By sharing her story, Sirleaf encourages women everywhere to pursue leadership roles at the highest levels of power, and gives us all hope that, with perseverance, we can change the world. \n",

Board of Education. Claiming he was acting to keep the peace, Gov. Orval Faubus used the Arkansas National Guard to keep them out of the school. After a lengthy standoff, President Eisenhower called in the 101st Airborne and reluctantly, slowly, but forcibly began to integrate the school. The standoff became a rallying cry for Southern segregationists and a marker of the country's shame. \n\nThe accounts that have been so mythologized over the years leave people embarrassed and angry, yet the myth is a cardboard cutout of the full story. Turn Away Thy Son, told from the point of view of sixteen key participants, brings the nine students, their tormentors, the school administration, the governor, and the press to vivid life. It shows the truth about Little Rock, beyond the caricatures to the fundamental driving forces that made school desegregation the hottest of hot-button issues in the Jim Crow South. \n",

They're going to ride bikes, paint, and camp together. But when the cousins arrive, everything's wrong: Rosie and Takeo are better painters than Lila, have skateboards instead of bikes, and don't want to camp outside. Lila is terribly disappointed until the cousins make her a surprise: a big banner for their best cousin Lila! Inspired by the author's own large, diverse family, When the Cousins Came is a sensitive story about insecurity, hosting, and friendship. Katie Yamasaki's tale, paired with bright mixed-media art, reminds children that negative thoughts and anxiety over exclusion don't always translate to reality, and that even when plans go wrong you can still have a good time together.

The period he is dealing with was murky, complex and controversial. It brought to light the differences that were undermining the army. The cleavage, which appeared under the military recovery committee for national progress (CMRPN), opposed the so-called Progressive officers and those called Conservatives. Member of the group of Progressives, Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, had to assume, against his will, the presidency of the People's Salvation Council (CSP) which overthrew the (CMRPN), on November 7, 1982. An excellent paediatrician, working outside the military field, he had no troops to command. Also, can we legitimately wonder what the doctor-commander went to look for in this galley? The reader will find in his writing possible answers to this question. This new emergency regime was a shaky compromise between so-called Progressive and so-called Conservative officers. This unstable balance could not last. Thus, on May 17, 1983, the clash between the two groups made the country aware of upheavals which would lead to August 4, 1983. By this writing, the commander Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo breaks with the famous Secret Defense which many officers like to wallow in deafening silence on infor...show more",

Cooper sets out to understand childbirth in a country with the world's highest fertility rate and an alarmingly high rate of maternal and infant mortality. Cooper shows how the environment, slavery and abolition, French military rule, and the rapid expansion of Islam have all influenced childbirth and fertility in Niger from the 19th century to the present day. She sketches a landscape where fear of infertility generates intense competition between communities, ethnicities, and co-wives and creates a culture where concerns about infertility dominate concerns about overpopulation, where illegitimate children are rejected, and where the education of girls is sacrificed in the name of avoiding shame. Given a medical system poorly adapted to women's needs, a precarious economy, and a political context where it is impossible to address sexuality openly, Cooper discovers that it is little wonder that pregnancy and birth are a woman's greatest pride as well as a source of grave danger. \n",

Their fight for suffrage took decades of campaigning and marching, protesting and picketing, speeches and imprisonments. Millions of women across the country gave their all to achieve victory. From Lucretia Mott, who stoked the first flames of the suffrage movement in the 1800s, to Alice Paul, the militant twentieth-century suffragist who helped clinch ratification, Women Win the Vote! maps the road to the Nineteenth Amendment through the lives of nineteen of these fierce and courageous women who paved the way. With vivid profiles of iconic figures like Sojourner Truth and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, as well as those who may be less well-known, like Mary Ann Shadd Cary and Adelina Otero-Warren, this vibrant collection celebrates the one hundredth anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment and the daring individuals who upended tradition to empower future generations of women. \n",

        "description": "A powerful coming-of-age novel, pulled from personal experience, about the meaning of friendship, the joyful beginnings of romance, and the racism and religious intolerance that can both strain a family to the breaking point and strengthen its bonds. Growing up in an affluent suburb of New York City, sixteen-year-old Nevaeh Levitz never thought much about her biracial roots. When her Black mom and Jewish dad split up, she relocates to her mom's family home in Harlem and is forced to confront her identity for the first time. Nevaeh wants to get to know her extended family, but because she inadvertently passes as white, her cousin thinks she's too privileged, pampered, and selfish to relate to the injustices African Americans face on a daily basis. In the meantime, Nevaeh's dad decides that she should have a belated bat mitzvah instead of a sweet sixteen, which guarantees social humiliation at her posh private school. But rather than take a stand, Nevaeh does what she's always done when life gets complicated: she stays silent. Only when Nevaeh stumbles upon a secret from her mom's past, finds herself falling in love, and sees firsthand the prejudice her family faces does she begin to realize she has her own voice. And choices. Will she continue to let circumstances dictate her path? Or will she decide once for all who and where she is me...show more",

They live in a beautiful house, with a caring family, and attend an exclusive missionary school. They're completely shielded from the troubles of the world. Yet, as Kambili reveals in her tender-voiced account, things are less perfect than they appear. Although her Papa is generous and well respected, he is fanatically religious and tyrannical at home--a home that is silent and suffocating. As the country begins to fall apart under a military coup, Kambili and Jaja are sent to their aunt, a university professor outside the city, where they discover a life beyond the confines of their father's authority. Books cram the shelves, curry and nutmeg permeate the air, and their cousins' laughter rings throughout the house. When they return home, tensions within the family escalate, and Kambili must find the strength to keep her loved ones together. Purple Hibiscus is an exquisite novel about the emotional turmoil of adolescence, the powerful bonds of family, and the bright promise of freedom. \n",

Neighbors while away afternoons at the local bar, swapping rumors about voodoo, incest, and illegitimate children. Usually they're gossiping about the Botens. \nIn this epic saga, Lolita Files unveils the hidden lives of three generations of the Boten clan, a family as cursed by fate as they are blessed with hope. There's Grandma Amalie, who's willing to sacrifice everything for her son; there's Grace, who manages to conceal the identity of her child's father for more than twenty years; there's Aunt Sukie, whose strange power over her husband, Walter, is matched only by the strength of her dark magic; and, finally, there's Lay, whose secret betrayals will set the Boten clan in motion, sending its members on a quest for self-discovery that will lead them from one end of the world to the other. \n",

        "description": "In the mid-1980s, Emmanuel Jal was a seven year old Sudanese boy, living in a small village with his parents, aunts, uncles, and siblings. But as Sudan's civil war moved closer--with the Islamic government seizing tribal lands for water, oil, and other resources--Jal's family moved again and again, seeking peace. Then, on one terrible day, Jal was separated from his mother, and later learned she had been killed; his father Simon rose to become a powerful commander in the Christian Sudanese Liberation Army, fighting for the freedom of Sudan. Soon, Jal was conscripted into that army, one of 10,000 child soldiers, and fought through two separate civil wars over nearly a decade. \nBut, remarkably, Jal survived, and his life began to change when he was adopted by a British aid worker. He began the journey that would lead him to change his name and to music: recording and releasing his own album, which produced the number one hip-hop single in Kenya, and from there went on to perform with Moby, Bono, Peter Gabriel, and other international music stars. \nShocking, inspiring, and finally hopeful, War Child is a memoir by a unique young man, who is determined to tell his story and in so doing bring peace to his homeland. \n",

Conspiracy and serial murder open the door to a compelling, intricately woven plot in this masterwork of suspense. \n\nEveryone faces uncertainty at some point in their lives. Even a brilliant surgeon like Kenzo Tenma is no exception. But there's no way he could have known that his decision to stop chasing professional success and instead concentrate on his oath to save peoples' lives would result in the birth of an abomination. The questions of good and evil now take on a terrifyingly real dimension. Years later, in Germany during the tumultuous post-reunification period, middle-aged childless couples are being killed one after another. The serial killer's identity is known. The reasons why he kills are not. Dr. Tenma sets out on a journey to find the killer's twin sister, who may hold some clues to solving the enigma of the Monster. \n",

When the Leopard, king of all the jungle animals, declares the time has come for a successor to marry his daughter and wear the crown, the bravest beasts gather for a competition. The creature capable of throwing a spear high enough in the air for him to count to ten before it reaches the ground will be declared the jungle's prince. After many of the strongest animals fail, an antelope steps forth to take the king's challenge, only to be ridiculed for his physical weakness.

Such popular representations are pervasive and often portray Black adolescents' consumer and leisure culture as corruptive, uncivilized, and pathological. \n\nIn She's Mad Real, Oneka LaBennett draws on over a decade of researching teenage West Indian girls in the Flatbush and Crown Heights sections of Brooklyn to argue that Black youth are in fact strategic consumers of popular culture and through this consumption they assert far more agency in defining race, ethnicity, and gender than academic and popular discourses tend to acknowledge. Importantly, LaBennett also studies West Indian girls' consumer and leisure culture within public spaces in order to analyze how teens like China are marginalized and policed as they attempt to carve out places for themselves within New York's contested terrains. \n",

        "description": "After a stormy night, a farmer, searching for his lost calf, finds a baby eagle that has been blown out of its nest. He takes it home and raises it with his chickens. When a friend comes to visit one day, he tells the farmer that an eagle should be flying high in the sky, not staying on the ground. But this eagle walks like a chicken, eats like a chicken, even thinks like a chicken, the farmer replies. \nTwice, the farmer's friend tries to get the eagle to fly, but it sees the chickens on the ground and drops down each time. At last the friend, followed by the farmer, carries the young eagle back into the mountains and places the great bird on a rocky ledge, just before sunrise. As the air is filled with golden light and the sun appears, the friend cries, Fly, Eagle, fly! and the eagle raises its wings and soars upward, out of sight. \nThis simply told yet dramatic story from Africa will delight children everywhere and encourage them to lift off and soar, as Archbishop Tutu puts it in his foreword. In lovely, expressive paintings of great beauty, sparked with touches of humor, Niki Daly, an internationally known artist, catches the essence of this powerful tale. \n",

The Clever Monkey is a classic folktale from West Africa told by Rob Cleveland. One day two greedy jungle cats discover a large piece of cheese. They want to share the piece of cheese but cannot decide how they can divide it fairly. A very clever little monkey loves cheese as well and when he sees the two cats arguing over the cheese, he uses this opportunity to trick the jungle cats into allowing him to eat practically all of the cheese. Unfortunately for the two cats, they never realize that they were completely tricked by a very clever monkey. This story comes from Africa. Variants of it ban be found among Brer Rabbit tales, with Brer Rabbit in the role of the monkey and Brer Fox in the role of the lion. There is a similar story in Native American folklore entitled, \"How Rabbit Fooled Wolf.\" Rob Cleveland is storyteller-in-residence at the Fernbank Museum of Natural History in Atlanta, Georgia and is the author of several Story Cove books. \n",

The sea is broken, fishermen say. The sea is empty. The genii have taken the fish elsewhere. For centuries, fishermen have launched their pirogues from the Senegalese port of Joal, where the fish used to be so plentiful a man could dip his hand into the grey-green ocean and pull one out as big as his thigh. But in an Atlantic decimated by overfishing and climate change, the fish are harder and harder to find. Here, Badkhen discovers, all boundaries are permeable--between land and sea, between myth and truth, even between storyteller and story. Fisherman's Blues immerses us in a community navigating a time of unprecedented environmental, economic, and cultural upheaval with resilience, ingenuity, and wonder. \n",

        "description": "Baltimore was once a vibrant manufacturing town, but today, with factory closings and steady job loss since the 1970s, it is home to some of the most impoverished neighborhoods in America. The Hero's Fight provides an intimate look at the effects of deindustrialization on the lives of Baltimore's urban poor, and sheds critical light on the unintended consequences of welfare policy on our most vulnerable communities. Drawing on her own uniquely immersive brand of fieldwork, conducted over the course of a decade in the neighborhoods of West Baltimore, Patricia Fernandez-Kelly tells the stories of people like D. B. Wilson, Big Floyd, Towanda, and others whom the American welfare state treats with a mixture of contempt and pity--what Fernandez-Kelly calls \"ambivalent benevolence.\" She shows how growing up poor in the richest nation in the world involves daily interactions with agents of the state, an experience that differs significantly from that of more affluent populations. While ordinary Americans are treated as citizens and consumers, deprived and racially segregated populations are seen as objects of surveillance, containment, and punishment.\nFernandez-Kelly provides new insights into such topics as globalization and its effects on industrial dec...show more",

Thabiti Lewis's analysis serves as a cultural biography, examining the liberation impulses in Bambara's writing, which is concerned with practices that advance the material value of the African American experience and exploring the introspection between artist production and social justice. This is the first monograph that focuses on Bambara's unique approach and important literary contribution to 1970s and 1980s African American literature. It explores her unique nationalist, feminist, Marxist, and spiritualist ethos, which cleared space for many innovations found in black women's fiction.\n\nDivided into five chapters, Lewis's study relies on Bambara's voice (from interviews and essays) to craft a \"spiritual wholeness aesthetic\"-a set of principles that comes out of her practices of liberation and entail family, faith, feeling, and freedom-that reveals her ability to interweave ethnic identity, politics, and community engagement and responsibility with the impetus of balancing black male and female identity influences and interactions...show more",

However, as Sasha Turner shows in this illuminating study, for almost thirty years before the slave trade ended, Jamaican slaveholders and doctors adjusted slave women's labor, discipline, and health care to increase birth rates and ensure that infants lived to become adult workers. Although slaves' interests in healthy pregnancies and babies aligned with those of their masters, enslaved mothers, healers, family, and community members distrusted their owners' medicine and benevolence. Turner contends that the social bonds and cultural practices created around reproductive health care and childbirth challenged the economic purposes slaveholders gave to birthing and raising children.\n\n\nThrough powerful stories that place the reader on the ground in plantation-era Jamaica, Contested Bodies reveals enslaved women's contrasting ideas about maternity and raising children, which put them at odds not o...show more",

        "description": "Aristotle accurately characterized humans as political animals. Whether through birth or from choice, people naturally cluster into groups for protection, advancement, and the pursuit of well-being. But Aristotle's description does not hint at the powerful binary tension within this human tendency. Leaders enhance a social group's sense of identity by appealing to the members' commitments and shared traditions, to their hopes, strengths, sacrifices, and fears. Often, however, they cultivate not only an awareness of difference but even a sense of superiority, since for every social group there are those outsider, the \"them\". Maintaining a group's solidarity can too easily lead to the righteousness of intolerance towards those who are excluded. The reinforcement of group-identity in this way runs so deep in human nature that holding up a mirror to ourselves inevitably reveals a split image: the people we want to see and the people we're glad we're not. Intolerance: Political Animals and Their Prey presents stark examples of how the \"us\" have treated the \"them\". The papers in this volume hold up various unflattering mirrors of intolerance from the areas of History, Law, Philosophy, Political Science, and Religion. The authors of these scholarly studies do not condemn. Rather, their research compels us to look at ourselves as the political animals we are. show more",

Saddled with the demands of a dual-career household and motherhood in an urban setting, her life was in a rut. She decided to pursue a job as the paper's West Africa bureau chief, an amazing but daunting opportunity to cover a swath of territory encompassing two dozen countries and 500 million people. Landing with her family in Dakar, Senegal, she quickly found their lives turned upside down as they struggled to figure out their place in this new region, along with a new family dynamic where she was the main breadwinner flying off to work while her husband stayed behind to manage the home front.

Jessica Cammaert addresses the state management of social practices such as female circumcision, nudity, prostitution, and \"illicit\" adoption as well as the hesitation to impose severe punishments for the slave dealing of females, particularly female children. She examines the gendered power relations and colonial attitudes that targeted women and children spanning pre- and postcolonial periods, the early postindependence years, and post-Nkrumah policies. In particular, Cammaert examines the limits of the male colonial gaze and argues that the power lay not in the gaze itself but in the act of \"looking away,\" a calculated aversion of attention intended to maintain the tribal community and retain control over the movement, sexuality, and labor of women and children.\n\nWith its examination of broader time periods and topics and its complex analytical arguments, Undesirable Practices makes a valuable contribution to literature in African studies, contemporary advocacy discourse, wome...show more",

Gunya spent a little over a decade with the rebels before deserting. While there, she gave birth to a son with Onen, an LRA soldier. Though abducted, she expresses her continued support for the LRA and their tactics, admitting that she sometimes thinks of going back to the lum [bush] when life becomes hard as a civilian at home.\"\n\nThis is not a book about crimes against humanity. Rather, it is an indictment of the very idea of humanity, the concept that lies at the heart of human rights and humanitarian missions. \n\nBased on fieldwork in northern Uganda, anthropologist and medical doctor Sam Dubal brings readers into the inner circle of the Lord's Resistance Army, an insurgent group accused of rape, forced conscription of children, and inhumane acts of violence.

In wry and sometimes hilarious prose, she stares down disaster and looks back with rage and love at the life of an extraordinary family in an extraordinary time. From 1972 to 1990, Alexandra Fuller--known to friends and family as Bobo--grew up on several farms in southern and central Africa. Her father joined up on the side of the white government in the Rhodesian civil war, and was often away fighting against the powerful black guerilla factions. Her mother, in turn, flung herself at their African life and its rugged farm work with the same passion and maniacal energy she brought to everything else.

Born in a small town in Mississippi in 1927, the daughter of a midwife and a sawmill worker, Leontyne Price might have grown up singing the blues. But Leontyne had big dreams--and plenty to be thankful for--as she surrounded herself with church hymns and hallelujahs, soaked up opera arias on the radio, and watched the great Marian Anderson grace the stage. While racism made it unlikely that a poor black girl from the South would pursue an opera career, Leontyne's wondrous voice and unconquerable spirit prevailed. Bursting through the door Marian had cracked open, Leontyne was soon recognized and celebrated for her leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera and around the world--most notably as the majestic Ethiopian princess in Aida, the part she felt she was born to sing. From award-winners Carole Boston Weatherford and Raul Colón comes the story of a little girl from Mississippi who became a beloved star--one whose song soared on the breath of her ancestors and paved the way for those who followed. \n",

Disrupted Childhoodsexplores the issues that arise from a mother's confinement and provides first-person accounts of the experiences of children with moms behind bars. Jane A. Siegel offers a perspective that recognises differences over the long course of a family's interaction with the criminal justice system. \n\nPresenting an unparalleled view into the children's lives both before and after their mothers are imprisoned, this book reveals the many challenges they face from the moment such a critical caregiver is arrested to the time she returns home from prison. Based on interviews with nearly seventy youngsters and their mothers conducted at different points of their parent's involvement in the process, the rich qualitative data of Disrupted Childhoods vividly reveals the lived experiences of prisoners' children, telling their stories in their own words. Siegel places the mother's incarceration in context with other aspects of the youths' experiences, including their family life and social worlds, and provides a unique opportunity to hear the voices of a group that has been largely silent until now. \n",

The books have been long out-of-print and are now available again in re-issues by Heinemann Kenya. The stories are oral tales handed down the generations by the people living near Lake Victoria. In this first of the series, the four stories are 'How the Goat Became our Friend'; 'How the Hawk and the Crow Came to Hate Each Other'; 'How the Beans Came to Have a Black Sport on Them'; and 'How the Leopard Got His Spots', and 'How the Hyena Got an Ugly Coat'.

For a young girl, it was a time of adventure and freedom, and Huxley paints an unforgettable portrait of growing up among the Masai and Kikuyu people, discovering both the beauty and the terrors of the jungle, and enduring the rugged realities of the pioneer life. \n",

Can one account for the powers of techno-science in terms that do not merely reproduce its own understanding of the world? \"Rule of Experts\" examines these questions through a series of interrelated essays focused on Egypt in the twentieth century. These explore the way malaria, sugar cane, war, and nationalism interacted to produce the techno-politics of the modern Egyptian state; the forms of debt, discipline, and violence that founded the institution of private property; the methods of measurement, circulation, and exchange that produced the novel idea of a national 'economy', yet made its accurate representation impossible; the stereotypes and plagiarisms that created the scholarly image of the Egyptian peasant; and, the interaction of social logics, horticultural imperatives, powers of desire, and political forces that turned programs of economic reform in unanticipated directions.

Because Scottish missionaries in Yemen interviewed each of the Oromo children shortly after their liberation, we have sixty-four structured life histories told by the children themselves.\n\n\nIn the historiography of slavery and the slave trade, first passage narratives are rare, groups of such narratives even more so. In this analytical group biography (or prosopography), Shell renders the experiences of the captives in detail and context that are all the more affecting for their dispassionate presentation. Comparing the children by gender, age, place of origin, method of capture, identity, and other characteristics, Shell enables new insights unlike anything in the existing literature for this region and period.show more",

Maybe the most fascinating monarch of his time, Emperor Haile Selassie I is the only monarch remaining in Africa, where the representative of the former great ruling dynasties have all been reduced to the status of \"Chiefs.\" He is the head of one of the oldest nations but, as this study uncovers, also the ruler of one of the younger advancing polities of modern times. \n\nThe work treats extensively of the most important aspects of this advance. One of the few important frontiers of economic, industrial, political and cultural development from a modern point of view, a country awaiting and inviting capital, skill and the spirit of progressive adventure, the land of Prester John has been completely transformed since Haile Selassie I was crowned Emperor on November 2nd, 1930. \nshow more",

Moorish begins with recipes for spice blends, dressings, relishes, pickles and preserves that best define the cuisine. With these basics in your pantry and refrigerator, you'll be able to transform the most mundane ingredients into deliciously different Moorish snacks and soups; meat, vegetable and poultry dishes; and irresistible cakes and desserts. Toss preserved lemon through risotto, or spice up a Sunday lamb roast with a baharat spice mix. For dessert, make a delectable mango tart flavoured with orange-blossom water or liven up weekend breakfast with hot lemon fritters and cinnamon sugar. Beautifully illustrated and written in Lucy's engaging style, Moorish is, above all, a passionate celebration of flavour that will inspire and delight the adventurous home cook. \n",

It all started with my coming across some important facts that have been lost in oblivion about the continent and its people. On further exploration, startling information came to light, not only about the African continent but also about how historians and researchers over the ages have manipulated theories to deliberately degrade the otherwise rich and influential heritage of Africa. This book discusses important yet unknown truths about the ancient Black civilizations and how they spread around the world, how the people and the beliefs of the African people have influenced different religions and how the Africans spread out into the world taking their knowledge, culture, art and architecture where ever they went. African history has helped shape and mold other civilizations over time without any due credit being given for it. \n",

Then Karina's grandfather starts tutoring Chris, and she discovers he's actually a nice, funny kid. But one afternoon something unimaginable happens--the three of them are assaulted by a stranger who targets Indian-American Karina and her grandfather because of how they look. Her grandfather is gravely injured and Karina and Chris vow not to let hate win. When Karina posts a few photos related to the attack on social media, they quickly attract attention, and before long her #CountMeIn post--What does an American look like? #immigrants #WeBelong #IamAmerican #HateHasNoHomeHere--goes viral and a diverse population begin to add their own photos.

If she felt sad, music cheered her up, and when she was happy, the piano helped her share that joy. Soon she was writing her own songs and performing in grand cathedrals. Then a revolution in Venezuela forced her family to flee to the United States. Teresa felt lonely in this unfamiliar place, where few of the people she met spoke Spanish. Worst of all, there was fighting in her new home, too--the Civil War. Still, Teresa kept playing, and soon she grew famous as the talented Piano Girl who could play anything from a folk song to a sonata--so famous, in fact, that President Abraham Lincoln wanted her to play at the White House! Yet with the country torn apart by war, could Teresa's music bring comfort to those who needed it most? \n",

It showcases relationships between families and schools and reveals the myriad of ways in which school-based decisions regarding disability, language and academic placement impact family dynamics. Treating the mothers as experts, this book uses testimonios to explore not only what mothers know but also how they develop funds of knowledge and how they apply them to their child's education. The stories shed light on how mothers perceive their child's disability, how they engage with their child and the value they place on bilingualism. The narratives reveal the complex lives mothers lead and the ways in which they strive to meet the academic and socioemotional needs of their children, regardless of the financial, physical and emotional costs to them.

        "description": "Protecting the Promise is the first book in the Culturally Sustaining Pedagogies Series edited by Django Paris. It features a collection of short stories told in collaboration with five Native families that speak to the everyday aspects of Indigenous educational resurgence rooted in the intergenerational learning that occurs between mothers and their children. The author defines \"resurgence\" as the ongoing actions that recenter Indigenous realities and knowledges, while simultaneously denouncing and healing from the damaging effects of settler colonial systems. By illuminating the potential of such educational resurgence, the book counters deficit paradigms too often placed on Indigenous communities. It also demonstrates the need to include Indigenous Knowledges within the curriculum for both in-school and out-of-school settings. These engaging narratives reframe Indigenous parents as critical and compassionate educators, cultural brokers, and storytellers who are central partners in the education of their children.Book Features:\n\nshow more",
